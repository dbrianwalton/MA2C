  <title>Accumulation Functions and the Definite Integral</title>
  <introduction>
    <title>Overview</title>
    <p>
      The concept of the <term>definite integral</term> can be motivated by the notion of accumulated change.
      When we learn about linear functions, the idea of a constant slope or rate of change serves as the fundamental concept.
      For a definite integral, we generalize this notion to a changing rate.
    </p>
    <p>
      In this section, we begin with an example of linear functions and piecewise linear functions as models of accumulation.
      Using these examples, we establish some basic principles that we want to hold in general.
      These principles become the fundamental properties of the definite integral.
    </p>
  </introduction>
  <subsection>
    <title>Linear Functions as Accumulation</title>
    <p>
      The word accumulation is defined as <q>the acquisition or gradual gathering of something</q> (Oxford Dictionary, <href ref="https://www.lexico.com/en/definition/accumulation"/>, accessed August 27, 2019).
      Consider a tank of water that has water added at a constant rate of <quantity><mag>5</mag><unit base="liter"/><per base="minute"/></quantity>.
      At the start of our observation, the tank contains <quantity><mag>200</mag><unit base="liter"/></quantity> of water.
      We wish to think of the amount of water in the tank as an accumulation of the water that has flowed into the tank as a function of time.
    </p>
    <p>
      Quantities that have a constant rate of change are modeled with linear functions,
      and the rate of change is used as the slope.
      If <m>V</m> is the volume of water that the tank contains (in liters)
      and <m>t</m> is the time of observation (in minutes),
      then the state of the tank is given by <m>(t,V)</m>.
      The equation that models the accumulation is then given by
      <me>V = 200 + 5t</me>.
      The <m>V</m>-intercept of 200 represents the starting value (when <m>t=0</m>),
      and the product <m>5t</m> represents the accumulation of additional water
      that is added during the interval of time <m>(0,t)</m>.
    </p>
    <p>
      The point-slope equation of a line similarly captures the idea of accumulation.
      Suppose after 10 minutes, the water flowing into the tank stops and water begins to drain at a rate of  <quantity><mag>15</mag><unit base="liter"/><per base="minute"/></quantity>.
      We can use our earlier model to find the volume of water after the 10 minutes of filling has completed,
      <me>V = 200 + 5(10) = 250</me>.
      This becomes a new initial value for the tank relative to the draining, which corresponds to a negative rate of change or slope.
      For <m>t \gt 10</m>, we have a new model,
      <me>V = 250 - 15(t-10)</me>.
      The expression <m>-15(t-10)</m> represents the accumulated loss of water.
      We multiply the rate <m>-15</m> by the <em>increment</em> of time <m>t-10</m>,
      since that is how long the tank was left to drain.
    </p>
    <p>
      Putting our models together, we obtain a piecewise function that represents the accumulation of water in the tank.
      <me>
        V = \begin{cases}
        200 + 5t, \amp 0 \le t \le 10, \\
        250 - 15(t-10), \amp t \gt 10.
        \end{cases}
      </me>
      We can think of the rate of accumulation <m>R</m> as another variable, which is also piecewise,
      <me>
        R = \begin{cases}
        5, \amp 0 \lt t \lt 10, \\
        -15, \amp t \gt 10.
        \end{cases}
      </me>
      We do not define <m>R</m> when <m>t=10</m> because of the ambiguity in how the transition occurs.
      Because <m>R</m> is the rate of accumulation corresponding to the accumulation <m>V</m>,
      we write <m>R = V'</m> (read <m>V</m>-prime).
      We will later learn that <m>R</m> is the derivative of <m>V</m> at points where <m>R</m> is continuous.

    <p>
      Given any piecewise constant rate of accumulation <m>f(x)=A'(x)</m> for an accumulation <m>A(x)</m>,
      we can easily compute the formulas for <m>A(x)</m> as a piecewise linear function.
      We repeatedly apply the point-slope equation of a line and require that <m>A(x)</m> is continuous at each transition point.
      This will then help motivate some general properties that will relate to the definite integral.
    </p>
    <example>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Suppose <m>f(x)=A'(x)</m> is defined as
          <me>
            f(x) = \begin{cases}
            3, \amp x \lt 2, \\
            -2, \amp 2 \lt x \lt 5, \\
            5, \amp x \gt 5.
            \end{cases}
          </me>
          If <m>A(0) = 2</m>, find <m>A(x)</m> as a piecewise function.
        </p>
      </statement>
      <solution>
        <p>
          Because the initial value is given as <m>A(0)=2</m>,
          we begin our construction at <m>x=0</m>.
          This point on the domain is inside the interval <m>x \lt 2</m>,
          so we start with a rate <m>A'=3</m>.
          The formula for <m>A(x)</m> with <m>x \lt 2</m> is therefore
          <me>A(x) = 2 + 3x, \quad x \lt 2</me>.
          So that <m>A(x)</m> is continuous, we must have <m>A(2) = 2+3(2) = 8</m>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Having found the value of <m>A(x)</m> on the interval <m>(-\infty,2]</m>,
          we next consider the interval <m>(2,5)</m> where <m>A'=-2</m>.
          Using our value <m>A(2)=8</m> as an initial value, we can write
          <me>A(x) = 8 + -2(x-2), \quad 2 \lt x \lt 5</me>.
          To have continuity at <m>x=5</m>, we require <m>A(5)=8+-2(3)=2</m>.
          Repeating the process on the last interval, <m>(5,\infty)</m>,
          where <m>A' = 5</m>, we obtain
          <me>A(x) = 2 + 5(x-5), \quad x \gt 5</me>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Putting the pieces together, we obtain our final piecewise representation of <m>A(x)</m>:
          <me>
            A(x) = \begin{cases}
            2 + 3x, \amp x \le 2, \\
            8 + -2(x-2), \amp 2 \lt x \le 5, \\
            2 + 5(x-5), \amp x \gt 5.
            \end{cases}
          </me>
        </p>
