    <title>Lines and Linear Functions</title>

    <p>
      Lines are perhaps the most important elementary geometric object.
      A line captures the idea of following a given direction without turning.
      In ordinary language, we sometimes think of a line as a smooth curve that we could draw.
      Mathematically, a line would then be a <em>straight line</em> or a straight curve that does not bend.
      Algebraically, we can define a line using an equation involving two variables.
      This section reviews the basic principles of the algebraic properties of lines.

      There are some special cases that describe horizontal and vertical lines.
      The <m>(x,y)</m> plane uses <m>x</m> as the horizontal axis (independent variable)
      and <m>y</m> as the vertical axis (dependent variable).
      So a horizontal line is a line where the dependent variable is constant
      while a vertical line is a line where the independent variable constant.

      All other lines have an equation that involves both variables.
      We often wish to think of the line as describing the dependent variable
      as a function of the independent variable.
      These equations involve the calculation of the slope, which represents a rate (or ratio) of change.

      Zeros are closely related to factoring.
      If we know the zeros, then we can immediately rewrite the polynomial in a factored form.
      On the other hand, if we know the factors,
      then we can quickly solve for the zeros without using the quadratic formula.

      There are some tricks to factoring that can be useful to know.
      Factoring is the reverse process of multiplying by distribution,
      so we start by noticing what happens when you multiply out two simple factors:
      <me>(x+a)(x+b) = x^2+(a+b)x+ab.</me>
      Notice that the coefficient of <m>x</m> is the sum <m>a+b</m> and the constant term is the product <m>ab</m>.
      When trying to factor a quadratic, look for numbers that multiply to give the product term and add to give the coefficient of <m>x</m>.
      This is often a matter of trial and error.

    <p>
      Knowing one root <m>x=r</m> of a quadratic <m>f(x)=ax^2+bx+c</m> so that <m>f(r)=0</m>,
      we know that <m>x-r</m> is a factor.
      The other factor can be determined easily.

      Synthetic division is a procedure that works for quadratics as well as higher order polynomials.
      This procedure uses a table that starts with the coefficients on the first row.
      For a more thorough discussion for higher-order polynomials,
      see <xref ref="synthetic-division-algorithm"/>.

        To divide a quadratic polynomial <m>f(x)=ax^2+bx+c</m> by the factor <m>x-r</m> (proposed root <m>x=r</m>),
        we will apply the following steps.
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <p>
            Create a table that will have three rows and three columns.
            The first row will have the coefficients <m>a</m>, <m>b</m> and <m>c</m> in the three columns.
            The first entry of the second row will always be 0.
            So the start of the table will look like the following.
            <me>\begin{matrix} a &amp; b &amp; c \\ 0 &amp; \underline{\phantom{WW}} &amp; \underline{\phantom{WW}} \\ \underline{\phantom{WW}} &amp; \underline{\phantom{WW}} &amp; \underline{\phantom{WW}} \end{matrix} </me>
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            We finish a column, starting with the first column,
            by adding the values from the first and second rows, which in this case gives <m>a</m> again.
            <me>\begin{matrix} a &amp; b &amp; c \\ 0 &amp; \underline{\phantom{WW}} &amp; \underline{\phantom{WW}} \\ a &amp; \underline{\phantom{WW}} &amp; \underline{\phantom{WW}} \end{matrix} </me>
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            We next update the second row of the next column by multiplying the most recent value in the third row by the proposed root value <m>r</m>, which in this case gives <m>ar</m>.
            <me>\begin{matrix} a &amp; b &amp; c \\ 0 &amp; ar &amp; \underline{\phantom{WW}} \\ a &amp; \underline{\phantom{WW}} &amp; \underline{\phantom{WW}} \end{matrix} </me>
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Add the values in the second column to update the third row to define the new coefficient <m>d=ar+b</m> (recall <xref ref="quadratic-simple-root-factor"/>)
            and multiply by <m>r</m> to update the second row.
            <me>\begin{matrix} a &amp; b &amp; c \\ 0 &amp; ar &amp; ar^2+br \\ a &amp; d=ar+b &amp; \underline{\phantom{WW}} \end{matrix} </me>
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            When we finish updating the third row by adding the values in the third column,
            we discover that the last entry in the third row corresponds to <m>f(r)=ar^2+br+c</m>.
            <me>\begin{matrix} a &amp; b &amp; c \\ 0 &amp; ar &amp; ar^2+br \\ a &amp; d=ar+b &amp; f(r)=ar^2+br+c \end{matrix} </me>
          </p>
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        Once the table is complete, we interpret the values in the third row as giving coefficients of the factored polynomial
        along with the value of the polynomial at <m>x=r</m> (called the remainder)
        and can write <me>f(x) = (x-r)(ax+d) + f(r).</me>
        If <m>f(r)=0</m> (remainder is 0), then this is an actual factorization
        <me>f(x) = (x-r)(ax+d).</me>
        Because synthetic division is quick, this can be a simple way to test for roots and factor simultaneously.

      First, we introduce some basic definitions.

    <definition xml:id="definition-monomial">
      <title>Monomials</title>
      <p>
        A <term>monomial</term> is an expression that is a constant multiple of a variable raised to a non-negative integer power, <m>a x^k</m>,
        where <m>k=0,1,2,3,\ldots</m> and <m>a \in \mathbb{R}</m>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Examples include <m>4x^2</m> (with <m>a=4</m> and <m>k=2</m>), <m>\frac{1}{3}x^7</m>
        (with <m>a=\frac{1}{3}</m> and <m>k=7</m>) and <m>3</m> (where <m>a=3</m> and <m>k=0</m>).
        The following are not monomials: <m>3\sqrt{x} = 3x^{1/2}</m> (since not an integer power)
        and <m>\frac{3}{x^2} = 3x^{-2}</m> since the power is a negative integer.

      <p>
        An algebraic expression that can be rewritten as a sum of monomials is called a <term>polynomial</term>.
        The monomials are called the <term>terms</term> of the polynomial.
        The monomial with the highest power is called the <term>leading term</term>
        and its power is called the <term>degree</term> of the polynomial.
        The constant multiples in the monomials are called <term>coefficients</term>
        and the coefficient in the leading term is called the <term>leading coefficient</term>.
      </p>
      <p>
        We usually write a polynomial with terms ordered by decreasing powers, called <term>standard form</term>.
        An abstract representation of a polynomial with degree <m>n</m> is written
        <me>p(x) = a_n x^n + a_{n-1}x^{n-1} + \cdots + a_2 x^2 + a_1 x + a_0</me>
        where the symbols <m>a_n, a_{n-1}, \ldots, a_0</m> represent the coefficients.
        A missing term is represented by a coefficient zero.

      Synthetic division is an algorithm that can both test if a value <m>x=r</m> is a root
      and determine the coefficients of the factored polynomial <m>q(x)</m> at the same time.
      Synthetic division for quadratic polynomials (degree <m>n=2</m>) is a special case of this process,

        Given a polynomial <m>p(x) = a_n x^n + a_{n-1} x^{n-1} + \cdots + \cdots + a_1 x + a_0</m> and a test value <m>x=c</m>,
        synthetic division is an algorithm for finding coefficients <m>b_{n-1},\ldots,b_0</m> of a polynomial
        <m>q(x) = b_{n-1} x^{n-1} + \cdots + b_1 x + b_0</m> and a remainder <m>r</m> such that
        <me>p(x) = (x-c) q(x) + r.</me>

        The coefficients for <m>q(x)</m> and the remainder are found using the steps below.
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <p>
            We will create a table with three rows and <m>n+1</m> columns.
            The first row consists of the coefficients of <m>p(x)</m>, using 0 for any skipped terms, 
            ordered by decreasing power.
            The first value of the second row is always 0.
            The table will start as follows: 
            <me>\begin{matrix} 
              a_n &amp; a_{n-1} &amp; \cdots &amp; a_1 &amp; a_0 \\ 
              0 &amp; \underline{\phantom{WW}} &amp; \cdots &amp; \underline{\phantom{WW}} &amp; \underline{\phantom{WW}} \\ 
              \underline{\phantom{WW}} &amp; \underline{\phantom{WW}} &amp; \cdots &amp; \underline{\phantom{WW}} &amp; \underline{\phantom{WW}} 
            \end{matrix}</me>
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            A column will always be completed (finding the third row) by adding the values in the first and second rows.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Once a column is complete, the second row of the next column is found 
            by multiplying the previous value in the third row by the test value <m>c</m>.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Repeat these two steps until the table is complete.
            The third row of the table gives the coefficients and remainder as follows: 
            <me>\begin{matrix} 
              a_n &amp; a_{n-1} &amp; \cdots &amp; a_1 &amp; a_0 \\ 
              0 &amp; c \cdot b_{n-1} &amp; \cdots &amp; c \cdot b_{1} &amp; c \cdot b_0 \\ 
              b_{n-1} &amp; b_{n-2} &amp; \cdots &amp; b_0 &amp; r 
            \end{matrix} </me> 
            The interpretation is that 
            <me>p(x) = (x-c)(b_{n-1} x^{n-1} + \cdots + b_1 x + b_0) + r.</me>
          </p>

    <example>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Use synthetic division with the polynomial <m>p(x)=x^3-6x+2</m> 
          with the test value <m>x=2</m> and interpret the result.
        </p>
      </statement>
      <solution>
        <p>
          Start by identifying the coefficients.
          Any missed terms have a coefficient of zero, 
          <me>p(x) = x^3 + 0 x^2 + -6x + 2.</me> 
          We start the synthetic division table using the coefficients in the first row.
          <me>\begin{matrix} 
            1 &amp; 0 &amp; -6 &amp; 2 \\ 
            0 &amp; \underline{\phantom{WW}} &amp; \underline{\phantom{WW}} &amp; \underline{\phantom{WW}} \\ 
            \underline{\phantom{WW}} &amp; \underline{\phantom{WW}} &amp; \underline{\phantom{WW}} &amp; \underline{\phantom{WW}} 
          \end{matrix}</me>
        </p>
        <p>
          We then finish filling the table.
          To find values in the second row, we use the previous result in the third row 
          and multiply by the test value 2.
          To find the values in the third row, we add the values in the column.
          The first value in the second row is always 0.
          The completed table is shown below.
          <me>\begin{matrix} 
            1 &amp; 0 &amp; -6 &amp; 2 \\ 
            0 &amp; 2 &amp; 4 &amp; -4 \\ 
            1 &amp; 2 &amp; -2 &amp; -2 
          \end{matrix}</me>
        </p>
        <p>
          Once the table is complete, we interpret the values in the third row 
          as coefficients and a remainder.
          The last value is the remainder, <m>r=-2</m>, 
          and the other values are the coefficients of a polynomial 
          whose degree is one smaller than the original, in this case <m>n-1=2</m>.
          That is, the quotient polynomial is <m>q(x) = x^2 + 2x - 2</m>.
          The original polynomial can be written 
          <md>
            <mrow>p(x) &amp;= (x-2)q(x) + r</mrow>
            <mrow>x^3-6x+2 &amp;= (x-2)(x^2+2x-2) + -2</mrow>
          </md> 
          The non-zero remainder means that <m>x-2</m> is not a factor 
          and also tells us that <m>p(2) = -2</m>.
        </p>
      </solution>

    <p>
      How do we know which numbers to try? 
      If you have access to a graph of the polynomial, 
      you should use the values for roots that you see.
      If you do not have access to a graph, 
      then you might be able to use the results of the Integer Root Theorem or Rational Root Theorem

      Exponential and logarithmic functions are related to the algebraic ideas of exponents and powers.
      An exponential function is a function involving powers where the power is a variable while the base is a constant.
      A logarithmic function is the inverse of an exponential function.

      Sometimes an exponential function is not written in its standard form.

          If we think of <m>2x-1</m> as a sum <m>2x-1=2x+-1</m>,

          and for any positive value <m>u \gt 0</m>, 
          <men>b^{\log_b(u)} = u.</men>

      <statement>
        <p>
          Find the exact value of <m>\log_4(32)</m>.
        </p>
      </statement>
      <solution>
        <p>
          The value of <m>\log_4(32)</m> is unknown, 
          so we use a variable and write the exponential equivalent equation 
          (see Equation <xref ref="logarithm-exponential-equivalence"/>).
          <me> x = \log_4(32) \quad \Leftrightarrow \quad 4^x = 32 </me> 
          The next step is to recognize that 4 and 32 are both powers of 2, 
          so we rewrite the equation in terms of powers of 2: 
          <me>(2^2)^x = 2^5 \quad \Leftrightarrow \quad 2^{2x} = 2^5.</me> 
          Now that we have an equation with the same base, 
          because exponentials are one-to-one, 
          the powers must be equal, <m>2x = 5</m>, 
          allowing us to solve for <m>x=\frac{5}{2}</m>, 
          which is the exact value for the logarithm.
        </p>
      </solution>
    </example>
    
    <example>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Solve the equation <me>2^{3x+1} = 5</me> for <m>x</m> using a logarithm.
        </p>
      </statement>
      <solution>
        <p>
          The equation we are solving can be rewritten in terms of exponential functions as <me>\exp_2(3x+1) = 5.</me> 
          This new equation emphasizes that the variable expression <m>3x+1</m> is the input of an exponential.
          (It is not necessary to write this fact, just to recognize it.) 
          The logarithm <m>\log_2</m> is the inverse of <m>\exp_2</m>, 
          which in composition with one another yields the identity <me>\log_2(2^{3x+1}) = 3x+1.</me> 
          Applying this operation to both sides of the original equation, we have 
          <me>\log_2(2^{3x+1}) = \log_2(5) \quad \Leftrightarrow \quad 3x+1 = \log_2(5).</me> 
          The expression <m>\log_2(5)</m> is just a value, so we can solve for <m>x</m>, 
          <me>x = \frac{\log_2(5) - 1}{3},</me> giving us our desired solution.

            <mrow xml:id="logarithm-of-product">\log_b(u \cdot v) &amp;= \log_b(u) + \log_b(v),</mrow>

        </p>
      </statement>
    </theorem>
    
    <p>
      It is most useful to remember the properties of logarithms conceptually.
      For example, Equation <xref ref="logarithm-of-product"/> states 
      that the logarithm of a product is equivalent to the sum of the logarithms of the factors.
      Similarly, Equation <xref ref="logarithm-of-quotient"/> states 
      that the logarithm of a quotient is equivalent to the difference of the logarithms 
      (and the logarithm of the denominator is subtracted).
      Finally, Equation <xref ref="logarithm-of-power"/> states 
      that the logarithm of a value raised to a power is equivalent 
      to the product of the power times the logarithm of the value.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Although there are valid logarithm functions for every base <m>b \gt 0</m> with <m>b \ne 1</m>, 
      calculators generally have only two specific bases.
      The <term>common logarithm</term> refers to the logarithm with base <m>b=10</m> 
      and is chosen to be conveniently related to scientific notation.
      The <term>natural logarithm</term> refers to the logarithm with base <m>b=e</m> (a special transcendental number).
      These two logarithms have their own special notation.
      The common logarithm (base 10) is often written without any base, 
      <me>\log(x) \equiv \log_{10}(x).</me> 
      The natural logarithm (base <m>e</m>) is often written <me>\ln(x) \equiv \log_{e}(x).</me>
    </p>
    
    <p>
      The properties of logarithms allow us to express the logarithm of any base 
      in terms of the logarithm of a base of your choice.
      This is accomplished through the change of base formula for logarithms.

          In particular, if we choose <m>a=e</m> (natural base),

      The strategy to prove these formulas is the same as would be used 
      to solve an equation with logarithms in terms of the natural or common logarithm.

    <example>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Solve the equation <m>2^{3x} = 5</m> in terms of the natural logarithm.

      <solution>
        <p>
          Starting with the equation involving the exponential, 
          we will apply the natural logarithm (as asked in the problem) to both sides of the equation.
          <me> 2^{3x}=5 \quad \Leftrightarrow \quad \ln(2^{3x}) = \ln(5)</me> 
          The left side of the equation is the logarithm of a power, 
          so we can use the corresponding logarithm property (Equation <xref ref="logarithm-of-power"/>) to say 
          <me> \ln(2^{3x}) = 3x \cdot \ln(2) = \ln(5).</me> 
          Dividing both sides of the equation by the product <m>3 \ln(2)</m> 
          we find <me> x = \frac{\ln(5)}{3 \ln(2)}</me> 
          which matches what we would get using the change of base formula 
          since <m>3 \ln(2) = \ln(2^3) = \ln(8)</m> (using Equation <xref ref="logarithm-of-power"/>.)

    <title>Absolute Value</title>
    
    <p>
      The absolute value operation takes a number and finds its magnitude (or distance from zero).
      Because magnitude is a non-negative value and positive and negative pairs are the same distance from zero, 
      we often imagine that the role of absolute value is to remove a negative sign, <m>|-3| = 3</m>.
      However, when a variable is involved, a negative sign means finding the inverse of a value 
      for which we may not know if it is positive or negative.
      So it is incorrect to say that <m>|-x| = x</m> (FALSE).
      The proper definition of absolute value uses a piecewise formula.

    It is sometimes useful to take advantage of an identity between the square root of a square and the absolute value.
    This is the source of the plus/minus when solving an equation with a square.

      The absolute value splits nicely with multiplication (and division).
      However, addition of two values with opposite signs shows that absolute values do not add: 
      <m>|3+-4| = |-1| \ne |3| + |-4| = 7</m>.
      Instead, we have an inequality called the triangle inequality.
