    <title>Consequences of the Mean Value Theorem</title>

    <introduction>
    <p>Just as the Mean Value Theorem for Integrals was used to describe the <xref ref='thm-monotonicity-from-rate-repeat' text='custom'>monotonicity of accumulation functions</xref> in terms of the sign of the rate function, the Mean Value Theorem allows us to find the monotonicity of any differentiable function in terms of the sign of its derivative.</p>

    <theorem xml:id='thm-monotonicity-from-derivative'>
        <title>Monotonicity of Differentiable Functions</title>
        <statement>
            <p>Suppose that <m>f</m> is a differentiable on an interval <m>I</m> (open or closed).
            <ul>
                <li><p>If <m>f'(x) \gt 0</m> for all <m>x \in I</m>, then <m>f(x)</m> is increasing on <m>I</m>.</p></li>
                <li><p>If <m>f'(x) \lt 0</m> for all <m>x \in I</m>, then <m>f(x)</m> is decreasing on <m>I</m>.</p></li>
                <li><p>If <m>f'(x) = 0</m> for all <m>x \in I</m>, then <m>f(x)</m> is constant on <m>I</m>.</p></li>
            </ul>
            </p>
            <p>If the interval <m>I</m> is open but <m>f</m> is continuous up to and including the end-points, then the conclusion can be extended to include the end-points as well.</p>
        </statement>
        <proof>
            <p>Consider any two points <m>a,b \in I</m> with <m>a \lt b</m>. Because <m>f</m> is differentiable on <m>I</m>, we know that <m>f</m> is <xref ref='thm-differentiable-implies-continuous' text='custom'>continuous</xref> and differentiable on the subinterval <m>[a,b]</m>. The <xref ref='mean-value-theorem' text='custom'>Mean Value Theorem</xref> guarantees the existence of a point <m>c \in (a,b)</m> such that <me>f(b)-f(a) = f'(c)\cdot(b-a).</me></p>
            <p>Now assume that <m>f'(x) \gt 0</m> for all <m>x \in I</m>. Then <m>f'(c) \gt 0</m> and <m>b-a \gt 0</m>, guaranteeing that <m>f(b)-f(a) \gt 0</m>. That is, <m>f(b) \gt f(a)</m>. This is what is needed to show that <m>f</m> is increasing on <m>I</m>.</p>
            <p>Next assume that <m>f'(x) \lt 0</m> for all <m>x \in I</m>. Then <m>f'(c) \lt 0</m> while <m>b-a \gt 0</m>, guaranteeing that <m>f(b)-f(a) \lt 0</m>. That is, <m>f(b) \lt f(a)</m>, which shows that <m>f</m> is decreasing on <m>I</m>.</p>
            <p>Finally assume that <m>f'(x) = 0</m> for all <m>x \in I</m>. Then <m>f'(c) = 0</m>, implying that <m>f(b)-f(a) = 0</m>. That is, <m>f(b) = f(a)</m>, which shows that <m>f</m> is constant on <m>I</m>.</p>
        </proof>

        <title>Describing Monotonicity Using Derivatives</title>

        <p>Because of the theorem about monotonicity, we can understand the behavior of a function if we can find all of the intervals on which the derivative is positive, negative or zero. The only points where <m>f'</m> might change sign are where <m>f'(x)=0</m> or where <m>f'(x)</m> is discontinuous.</p>
        <p>Our strategy will be as follows.
        <ol>
            <li><p>Compute <m>f'(x)</m>.</p></li>
            <li><p>Solve the equation <m>f'(x)=0</m>.</p></li>
            <li><p>Use the roots and discontinuities of <m>f'(x)</m> to identify all relevant intervals.</p></li>
            <li><p>Test the sign of <m>f'(x)</m> on each interval.</p></li>
            <li><p>Apply the Monotonicity theorem to determine the behavior of <m>f</m> on each interval.</p></li>
        </ol>
        </p>
        <example>
            <statement>
                <p>Describe the intervals of monotonicity for the function <m>f(x) = x^3-2x^2-4x</m>.</p>
            </statement>
            <solution>
              <p>
                <ul>
                <li>
                    <p>Compute <m>f'(x) = 3x^2-4x-4</m>.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Solve <m>f'(x)=0</m>. This will require factoring. <md>
                        <mrow>3x^2-4x-4=0</mrow>
                        <mrow>(3x+2)(x-2)=0</mrow>
                    </md> There are two possibilities, <m>3x+2=0</m> or <m>x-2=0</m>. The first leads to <m>x=-\frac{2}{3}</m>; the second leads to <m>x=2</m>.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p><m>f'(x)</m> exists for every value <m>x</m>, so we use these two roots to break the number line into intervals: <m>(-\infty, -\frac{2}{3})</m>, <m>(-\frac{2}{3},2)</m> and <m>(2,\infty)</m>. It can be convenient to use a graphical number line to identify the intervals, as shown below. We put <m>x</m>-values below the line and the corresponding values of <m>f'(x)</m> above the line. </p>

                    <p>We test the sign of <m>f'(x)</m> at a point in each of the intervals.

        <title>Describing Extreme Values Using Derivatives</title>

        <p><xref ref='fermats-theorem' text='custom'>Fermat's theorem</xref> states that a function <m>f</m> can have an extreme value only at points where either <m>f'(x)=0</m> or <m>f'(x)</m> does not exist. This motivates the definition of <term>critical points</term>.</p>

        <definition xml:id='defn-critical-points'>
            <title>Critical Points</title>
            <statement>
                <p>Given a function <m>f</m> with domain <m>D</m>, a value <m>c \in D</m> is a <term>critical point</term> of <m>f</m> if <m>f'(c)=0</m> or <m>f'(c)</m> does not exist.</p>
            </statement>
        </definition>

        <p>Not every critical point is an extreme value. We need criteria to judge whether or not a given critical point is the location of a maximum or minimum value. Intervals of monotonicity, as determined by the derivative, allow us to make that conclusion. Using monotonicity to classify critical points is justified by the following theorem, known as the first derivative test.</p>

        <theorem xml:id='first-derivative-test'>
            <title>First Derivative Test for Local Extrema</title>
            <statement>
                <p>Suppose that <m>f</m> is continuous at a critical point at <m>x=c</m>. If <m>f</m> is monotone on intervals immediately to the left and right of <m>c</m>, then the critical point can be classified as follows.</p>
                <p>If <m>f</m> is increasing on the left of <m>c</m> and decreasing on the right of <m>c</m>, then <m>f</m> has a <em>local maximum</em> at <m>x=c</m>.</p>
                <p>If <m>f</m> is decreasing on the left of <m>c</m> and increasing on the right of <m>c</m>, then <m>f</m> has a <em>local minimum</em> at <m>x=c</m>.</p>
                <p>Otherwise, <m>f</m> has neither a local maximum or minimum at <m>x=c</m>.</p>
            </statement>
        </theorem>

        <p>The first derivative test is usually applied by looking at the number line summary of the first derivative.</p>

        <example>
            <statement>
                <p>Find and classify the local extremes of <m>f(x) = x^3(x^2-4)</m>.</p>
            </statement>
            <solution>
                <p>Start by finding the critical points, which requires knowing the derivative. <me>f(x)=x^5-4x^3 \qquad \Rightarrow \qquad f'(x) = 5x^4-12x^2 = x^2(5x^2-12)</me> Now solve <m>f'(x)=0</m>, which gives either <m>x^2=0</m> or <m>5x^2-12=0</m>. There are three solutions: <m>x=0</m> and <m>x=\pm \sqrt{\frac{12}{5}}</m>. Because <m>f'(x)</m> is defined for all values of <m>x</m>, these three are the only critical points.</p>
                <p>We test if the critical points are local extremes by seeing if the direction of monotonicity changes at these points. This is summarized using a number line. Testing the value of <m>f'(x)</m> at points, such as the set <m>\{-2, -1, 1, 2\}</m>, gives us the following signs for the rate of change.</p>

        <p>Concavity is described by finding where the derivative is increasing or decreasing. Since the derivative is itself a function, we can find its derivative. This function will be the derivative of the derivative of the function <m>f</m>, or the <term>second derivative</term>.

            <p>The concavity of a parabola is completely determined by the sign of the leading coefficient. Suppose <m>f(x) = ax^2+bx+c</m>, where <m>a</m>, <m>b</m> and <m>c</m> are parameters. Then <m>f'(x) = 2ax+b</m> and <m>f''(x)=2a</m>. The second derivative for a quadratic is constant, and the sign is determined by the sign of <m>a</m>. If <m>a \gt 0</m>, <m>f</m> is concave up on <m>(-\infty,\infty)</m>; if <m>a \lt 0</m>, <m>f</m> is concave down on <m>(-\infty,\infty)</m>.</p>

        <p>When a second derivative can be determined conveniently, there is another way to determine whether a critical point is a turning point corresponding to a local extreme. Suppose <m>f'(a)=0</m> but <m>f''(a)</m> is positive. This means that <m>f'(x)</m> is increasing in a neighborhood of <m>x=a</m>. Consequently, <m>f'(x) \lt 0</m> in an interval with <m>x \lt a</m> and <m>f'(x) \gt 0</m> in an interval with <m>x \gt 0</m>. By the First Derivative Test, <m>f(x)</m> must have a minimum at <m>x=a</m>.</p>
        <p>Graphically, this means that at <m>x=a</m> there is a horizontal tangent with the graph concave up (like a parabola). This point then behaves like the vertex of a parabola opening upward and <m>x=a</m> is a local minimum. Similarly if <m>f''(a) \gt 0</m>, the function is concave down and the graph behaves somewhat like a downward opening parabola and the point <m>x=a</m> would be a local maximum. These results are summarized as a theorem.</p>

The Second Derivative Test has us compute <m>f''(x)=20x^3-24x</m> and determine the sign of <m>f''(x)</m> at each of the critical points.<md>
                    <mrow>f''(x) &amp;= 20x^3-24x = 4x(5x^2-6)</mrow>
                    <mrow>f''(0) &amp;= 0</mrow>
                    <mrow>f''(-\sqrt{\frac{12}{5}}) &amp;= -4 \sqrt{\frac{12}{5}} (5(\frac{12}{5})-6) = -24 \sqrt{\frac{12}{5}} \lt 0</mrow>
                    <mrow>f''(+\sqrt{\frac{12}{5}}) &amp;= +4 \sqrt{\frac{12}{5}} (5(\frac{12}{5})-6) = 24 \sqrt{\frac{12}{5}} \gt 0</mrow>
                </md> The Second Derivative Test is inconclusive about <m>x=0</m> being a turning point. Since <m>f(x)</m> is locally concave down at the critical point <m>x=-\sqrt{\frac{12}{5}}</m>, the Second Derivative Test implies that <m>f(x)</m> has a local maximum at this point. Similarly, <m>f(x)</m> has a local minimum at <m>x=+\sqrt{\frac{12}{5}}</m>.</p>
            </solution>
        </example>

        <p>From a practical point of view, in order to find the critical points, you will already have had to factor <m>f'(x)</m>. If finding the signs of <m>f'(x)</m> on the resulting intervals will be faster than computing <m>f''(x)</m> and then computing the sign at each critical points, then the First Derivative Test is a better strategy. The second derivative test is useful if finding <m>f''(x)</m> will be especially easy, or at least easier than finding the signs of <m>f'(x)</m>.</p>
