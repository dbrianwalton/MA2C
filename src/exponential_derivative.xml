    <title>The Derivative of Exponential Functions</title>
    <introduction>
      <p>
        We learned that the elementary exponential functions are of the form
        <me>\exp_b(x) = b^x</me>
        for positive real numbers <m>b</m>.
        Because exponential functions involve powers,
        a common mistake students make is to use the power rule of derivatives.
        That rule only applies to power functions,
        where the independent variable is the base and the exponent is a constant.
        We will need a new rule for exponential functions.
      </p>
      <p>
        In this section, we explore the derivative rule associate with exponential functions.
        As this is a new rule, we return to the definition of the derivative.
        We will learn that the derivative of an exponential function
        is proportional to the value of the function itself.
        The constant of proportionality is found using the base of the exponential.

      <title>Elementary Exponential Functions</title>
      <p>
        The definition of the derivative allows us to develop a new differentiation rule.
        The key property necessary for the exponential function is a consequence of the properties of exponents,
        <me> \exp_b(x+y) = b^{x+y} = b^x \cdot b^y = \exp_b(x) \cdot \exp_b(y).</me>
        Using these properties
        <md>
          <mrow> \exp_b'(x) &amp;= \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{\exp_b(x+h) - \exp_b(x)}{h} </mrow>
          <mrow> &amp;= \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{b^{x+h} - b^x}{h} </mrow>
          <mrow> &amp;= \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{b^x b^h - b^x}{h} </mrow>
          <mrow> &amp;= \lim_{h \to 0} \exp_b(x) \cdot \frac{b^h-1}{h} </mrow>
          <mrow> &amp;= \exp_b(x) \cdot \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{b^{h}-1}{h}.</mrow>
        </md>
      </p>
      <p>
        This means that the derivative of <m>b^x</m> is just <m>b^x</m> times some
        number <m>L(b)</m> that depends on <m>b</m>,
        <me> \frac{d}{dx}[b^x] = b^x \cdot L(b),</me>
        where <m>L(b)</m> is calculated as the limit
        <me> L(b) = \lim_{h \to 0}\frac{b^h-1}{h}. </me>
        Unfortunately, this is not a limit that we know as of yet.
        The following table illustrates some approximations for the value of this limit for a variety of bases.

    <p>
      Every positive real number <m>b</m> has such a limit, <m>L(b)</m>.
      This limit corresponds to the slope of the elementary exponential function <m>y=b^x</m>
      at the point <m>x=0</m>,
      <me> L(b) = \exp_b'(0) = \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{b^{0+h} - b^{0}}{h} = \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{b^h-1}{h}. </me>
      For the four bases used above, this corresponds to the following derivatives:
      <md>
        <mrow> \frac{d}{dx}[2^x] &amp;= L(2) \cdot 2^x \approx 0.69315 \cdot 2^x </mrow>
        <mrow> \frac{d}{dx}[3^x] &amp;= L(3) \cdot 3^x \approx 1.09861 \cdot 3^x </mrow>
        <mrow> \frac{d}{dx}[5^x] &amp;= L(5) \cdot 5^x \approx 1.60944 \cdot 5^x </mrow>
        <mrow> \frac{d}{dx}[10^x] &amp;= L(10) \cdot 10^x \approx 2.30259 \cdot 10^x </mrow>
      </md>
    </p>
    <p>
      We can see from the table that <m>L(2)\approx 0.69315</m> and <m>L(3) \approx 1.09861</m>.
      This suggests that there is a particular base <m>b</m> between 2 and 3 such that <m>L(b)=1</m>.
      Such a value does exist, using <m>b \approx 2.71828183</m>.
      This value has the property that the elementary exponential function and its derivative are exactly equal.
      The base is called the <term>natural base</term> and is given the special symbol <m>e</m>.
      Consequently,
      <me> \frac{d}{dx}[e^x] = e^x. </me>
      Every other exponential function is proportional to its derivative,
      but with the proportionality constant <m>L(b) \ne 1</m>.
      We will soon discover another way to find <m>L(b)</m> for these other bases.

    <title>The Chain Rule with Exponentials</title>
    <p>
      Because the exponential function <m>\exp(x) = e^x</m> is defined with the natural base,
      <m>\exp'(x) = e^x</m> is the same as the original function, <m>\exp'=\exp</m>.
      Combining this with the <xref ref="thm-chain-rule" text="title">chain rule</xref>,
      we get a generalized derivative of compositions with exponentials,
      <me xml:id="exponential-chain-rule"> \frac{d}{dx}[e^{u(x)}] = e^{u(x)} \cdot u'(x) = e^{u} \cdot \frac{du}{dx}. </me>
    </p>
    <example>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Find the derivatives of the following functions.

            <li> <m>g(x) = e^{x^3}</m> </li>
            <li> <m>h(x) = e^{x^2-4x}</m> </li>
          </ol>
        </p>
      </statement>
      <solution>
        <p>
        In each case, we will identify the formula <m>u(x)</m> and then apply the chain rule.
        <ol>
          <li>
            <p>
              For <m>f(x) = e^{5x}</m>, we have <m>u(x)=5x</m> so that <m>f(x) = e^u</m>.
              We will use <m>u'(x)=5</m>.
              The chain rule gives:
              <md>
                  <mrow>f'(x) &amp;= \frac{d}{dx}[e^{5x}] </mrow>
                  <mrow> &amp; \underset{(u=5x)}{=} \frac{d}{dx}[e^u] \underset{(u=5x)}{=} e^u \frac{du}{dx} </mrow>
                  <mrow> &amp;= e^{5x} \cdot 5 = 5e^{5x} </mrow>
              </md>
              So <m>f'(x) = 5e^{5x}</m>.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              The function <m>g(x) = e^{x^3}</m> involves a composition with <m>u(x)=x^3</m>
              such that <m>u'(x)=3x^2</m>.
              <md>

                <mrow> &amp;= e^{x^3} \cdot (3x^2) = 3x^2 e^{x^3} </mrow>
              </md>
              Thus <m>g'(x) = 3x^2e^{x^3}</m>.

          <li>
            <p>
              The function <m>h(x) = e^{x^2-4x}</m> involves a composition with <m>u(x)=x^2-4x</m>

              <md>

    <title>Other Exponential Bases</title>
    <p>
      Every function involving a positive base raised to an exponent can be rewritten
      using the natural exponential function <m>\exp(x)=e^x</m>.
      Recall that the exponential and the logarithm are inverse functions
      so that for every number <m>u \gt 0</m> we have
      <me> \exp(\ln(u)) e^{\ln(u)} = u. </me>
      This identity and the rules for logarithms show that any power <m>u^w</m> with <m>u \gt 0</m>
      can be rewritten as
      <me> u^w = \exp(\ln(u^w)) = e^{\ln(u^w)} = e^{w \cdot \ln(u)}. </me>
    </p>
    <example>
      <statement>
        <p>
        Rewrite each of the following in terms of the natural exponential function.
        <ol>
          <li> <m>f(x) = 2^x</m> </li>
          <li> <m>g(x) = 5^x</m> </li>
          <li> <m>p(x) = x^{3/4}</m> </li>

        <ol>
          <li> <m>f(x) = 2^x = \exp(\ln(2^x)) = e^{\ln(2^x)} = e^{x \ln(2)}</m> </li>
          <li> <m>g(x) = 5^x = \exp(\ln(5^x)) = e^{\ln(5^x)} = e^{x \ln(5)}</m> </li>
          <li> <m>p(x) = x^{3/4} = \exp(\ln(x^{3/4})) = e^{\ln(x^{3/4})} = e^{\frac{3}{4}\ln(x)}</m> </li>
          <li> <m>r(x) = x^x = \exp(\ln(x^x)) = e^{\ln(x^x)} = e^{x \ln(x)}</m> </li>
        </ol>
      </p>
      </solution>
    </example>
    <p>
      Because every exponential can be rewritten in terms of the natural exponential,
      we have a special result for all other exponential functions,
      <me> b^x = e^{x \cdot \ln(b)}. </me>
      Using the chain rule with <m>u=x \cdot \ln(b)</m> and <m>\frac{du}{dx}=\ln(b)</m>,
      we discover
      <me xml:id="general-exponential-deriv"> \frac{d}{dx}[b^x] = \frac{d}{dx}[e^{x \ln(b)}] = e^{x \ln(b)} \cdot \ln(b) = b^x \cdot \ln(b). </me>
      Because we already had a formula <m>\frac{d}{dx}[b^x] = L(b) \cdot b^x</m>,
      we now have an exact expression for the limit <m>L(b)</m>:
      <me> L(b) = \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{b^h-1}{h} = \ln(b). </me>

  <subsection>
    <title>Power Function or Exponential Function</title>
    <p>
      One of the challenges for a calculus novice is identifying which rule applies.
      It is essential that you can distinguish between an exponential function and a power function.
    </p>
    <p>
      Recall that a power function has a constant power while an exponential function has a constant as the base.
      Furthermore, don't be fooled by numbers that look like other symbols.
      For example, <m>x^e</m> is a power function since the power is the constant value <m>e</m> (the natural exponential base):
      <me> \frac{d}{dx}[x^e] = e x^{e-1}. </me>
      Similarly, <m>x^{\sqrt{2}}</m> is a power function because the power <m>\sqrt{2}</m> is a number
      (even though it is represented as a formula, it does not have any variables):
      <me> \frac{d}{dx}[x^{\sqrt{2}}] = \sqrt{2} x^{\sqrt{2}-1}. </me>
    </p>
    <p>
      Furthermore, you must look at a formula and determine which operation determines the
      differentiation rule that is required (constant multiple, sum, product, quotient or chain).
      This is always based on the last operation to be applied under the rules of order of operations.
      When the number of steps is small, you should be able to write the derivative down directly.
      When the number of steps is large, you might need to use the differentiation operator to
      allow yourself the chance to work part of the way and indicate that there are still steps remaining.
    </p>
    <example>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Find the derivative <m>\displaystyle \frac{d}{dx}[ (x^2+4)^5 e^{5x^3} ]</m>.
        </p>
      </statement>
      <solution>
        <p>
          Start by identifying the final operation. In this problem, the function
          <m>f(x) = (x^2+4)^5 e^{5x^3}</m> is a product of <m>(x^2+4)^5</m> and <m>e^{5x^3}</m>.
          So we begin by using the product rule. If you want to emphasize this without having
          to write down the derivatives of the factors, then we use the differentiation operator:
          <me> f'(x) = \frac{d}{dx}[(x^2+4)^5] \cdot e^{5x^3} + (x^2+4)^5 \cdot \frac{d}{dx}[e^{5x^3}]. </me>
          Notice that the differentiation operator is pointing out where we still need to find derivatives
          in order to complete the problem.
        </p>
        <p>
          The first term <m>(x^2+4)^5</m> should be recognized as a composition with a
          power function <m>u^5</m> where <m>u=x^2+4</m>. We will use the chain rule:
          <me> \frac{d}{dx}[(x^2+4)^5] \underset{(u=x^2+4)}{=} \frac{d}{du}[u^5] \cdot \frac{du}{dx}
          = 5(x^2+4)^4 \cdot (2x). </me>
          The second term <m>e^{5x^3}</m> should be recognized as a composition with
          the exponential function <m>e^u</m> where <m>u=5x^3</m>. Again, the chain rule guides us:
          <me> \frac{d}{dx}[e^{5x^3}] \underset{(u=5x^3)}{=} \frac{d}{du}[e^u] \cdot \frac{du}{dx}
          = e^{5x^3} \cdot (15x^2). </me>
        </p>
        <p>
          The previous paragraph represents work that you either think through mentally or
          write out as scratch work. Putting the pieces together gives us the overall answer.
          <md>
            <mrow> f'(x) = \frac{d}{dx}[(x^2+4)^5 e^{5x^3}]
            &amp; = \frac{d}{dx}[(x^2+4)^5] \cdot e^{5x^3} + (x^2+4)^5 \cdot \frac{d}{dx}[e^{5x^3}]</mrow>

          </md>
        </p>
        <p>
          As we start to use our derivatives in applications, we will often need to factor our formulas.
          To illustrate this principle, we identify all of the common factors of the terms.
