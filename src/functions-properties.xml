    <title>Algebraic Properties of Functions</title>

    <introduction>
        <title>Overview</title>
        
        <p>A function can have many different representations. We often need to use these different representations in different settings. For example, polynomials usually are written as a sum of terms. Multiplication and division of polynomials usually work best in this representation. However, to find the roots or zeros of a polynomial, a factored representation is preferred. In order to change representations, we need to understand when two formulas represent the same function.</p>
        <p>This section reviews the elementary rules of algebra and explores how these rules lead to algebraic properties of functions. The fundamental properties of addition and multiplication motivate additional rules, such as rules for fractions and powers. We will then apply these rules to understand properties of the exponential and logarithm functions. In order to learn to apply these rules, it is essential to recognize the structure of expressions as discussed in <xref ref="subsection-combining-expressions"/>.</p>

        <title>Algebraic Properties</title>
        
        <p>An algebraic representation of a function is an expression (formula) that computes the value of the dependent variable in terms of the independent variable. We say that two representations are <term>equivalent</term> if they give the same values. We will often need to be able to find equivalent expressions that will allow us to simplify our work. To find these equivalent representations, we rely on algebraic properties of the operations and elementary functions of algebra.</p>
        
        <p>The properties of arithmetic form the foundation for all other equivalence properties. The two basic arithmetic operations are addition and multiplication. Subtraction and division are inverse operations and are ultimately defined in terms of addition and multiplication.</p>

        <p>Students often encounter difficulties with expressions involving fractions. However, all of the algebra rules for fractions really are consequences of the basic properties of multiplication. Recognizing these connections and using them to guide your work will help you avoid common pitfalls. The first key is to remember that fractions are division and therefore really multiplication.</p>

        <p>The basic properties of powers, shown below, can not be proved easily for all real numbers. We can motivate each property with integer powers using the properties of multiplication. Rational powers are more complicated and involve roots, but irrational powers are too difficult for this text.</p>

            <statement>
                <p>For integer exponents, a power means repeated multiplication (similar to how multiplication by an integer means repeated addition). So <m>b^3 = b \cdot b \cdot b</m>. The product properties are just about counting. <md>

        <p>Addition and powers have no convenient properties. Many mistakes occur when students forget this and imagine that powers distribute like multiplication. (It doesn't!)</p>
        
        <example>
            <p>To illustrate that <m>(a+b)^2 \ne a^2+b^2</m>, consider the numbers <m>a=2</m> and <m>b=3</m>. The first expression gives <me>(a+b)^2 = (2+3)^2 = 5^2 = 25</me> while the second expression gives <me>a^2+b^2=2^2+3^2=4+9=13.</me> The proper way to expand the first expression is to think of the power as repeated multiplication and apply the distributive property. This is often called the <c>FOIL</c> method: <me>(a+b)^2=(a+b)(a+b)=a^2+2ab+b^2</me>.</p>
        </example>
        
        <example>
            <p>To illustrate that <m>\sqrt{a^2+b^2} \ne a+b</m>, again consider the numbers <m>a=2</m> and <m>b=3</m>. The first expression gives <me>\sqrt{a^2+b^2} = \sqrt{2^2+3^2}=\sqrt{13},</me> and the second expression gives <me>a+b=2+3=5.</me> There is no convenient way to expand a square root.</p>
        </example>
        
        <p>If you see any operation acting on a sum (e.g., powers, roots or functions), unless you know a specific rule, you should not break up the formula into individual parts. Such rules are called sum rules and will play a very important role in calculus.</p>

        <p>The elementary exponential functions <m>\exp_b(x)=b^x</m> provide an interesting exception to the general principle that a sum inside an operation can not be simply rewritten. They inherit a property from powers: <me>\exp_b(x+y) = b^{x+y} = b^x \cdot b^y</me>. Such a rule might be remembered as <q>the exponential of a sum is the product of exponentials</q>. Similarly, we have related properties for quotients and powers.</p>

        <p>Historically, the logarithm was invented so that multiplication and division calculations could be solved using the much simpler operations of addition and subtraction. Engineers and scientists would often reference logarithm tables. The slide rule was a mechanical implementation, where the lengths corresponding to logarithm values were added physically to get a new length.</p>

The factors identified are <m>4</m>, <m>x^3</m>, <m>(2x+5)^{\frac{1}{2}}</m>, and <m>(x^2+3)^{-5}</m>. Using the logarithm's product rule followed by the logarithm's power rule, we find <md>

        <p>The properties of logarithms help solve us equations, particularly where the variable is in an exponent. Because inverse functions are one-to-one, we can apply such a function to both sides of an equation with positive values and form a new equation that is equivalent to the first. The properties of the logarithm can then be used to our advantage.</p>

                    <mrow> 2^{3x} = \frac{5}{3} </mrow>
                </md> We next apply the logarithm base 10 to both sides of this equation, which then allows us to apply the logarithm power rule on the left. Then we can isolate <m>x</m>. <md>

                </md></p>
                <p>Alternatively, we could have applied the logarithm at the very first. This would require using the logarithm product rule on the left. <md>

        <p>Closely related to change of base formula is the fact that we can rewrite any power with a positive base using a composition with an elementary exponential. We will soon discover that the number <m>e</m> is the natural exponential base. Thus, every power can be rewritten in terms of the natural exponential function. The logarithm with this base is the <term>natural logarithm</term> <m>\ln</m>.</p>

            <solution>
                <p>One approach is to use the inverse property, <m>\exp(\ln(u)) = e^{\ln(u)} = u</m>, on the factor with the power. Then use logarithm properties to simplify (expand) the power. <md>
