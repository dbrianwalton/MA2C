  <title>Algebraic Properties of Functions</title>

  <introduction>
    <title>Overview</title>
    
    <p>
    A function can have many different representations.
    We often need to use these different representations in different settings.
    For example, polynomials usually are written as a sum of terms.
    Multiplication and division of polynomials usually work best in this representation.
    However, to find the roots or zeros of a polynomial, a factored representation is preferred.
    In order to change representations, we need to understand when two formulas represent the same function.
    </p>
    <p>
    This section reviews the elementary rules of algebra and explores 
    how these rules lead to algebraic properties of functions.
    The fundamental properties of addition and multiplication motivate additional rules, 
    such as rules for fractions and powers.
    We will then apply these rules to understand properties of the exponential and logarithm functions.
    In order to learn to apply these rules, it is essential to recognize the structure of expressions 
    as discussed in <xref ref="subsection-combining-expressions"/>.

    <title>Algebraic Properties</title>
    
    <p>
    An algebraic representation of a function is an expression (formula) that computes 
    the value of the dependent variable in terms of the independent variable.
    We say that two representations are <term>equivalent</term> if they give the same values.
    We will often need to be able to find equivalent expressions that will allow us to simplify our work.
    To find these equivalent representations, 
    we rely on algebraic properties of the operations and elementary functions of algebra.
    </p>
    
    <p>
    The properties of arithmetic form the foundation for all other equivalence properties.
    The two basic arithmetic operations are addition and multiplication.
    Subtraction and division are inverse operations and are ultimately defined in terms of addition and multiplication.

    Students often encounter difficulties with expressions involving fractions.
    However, all of the algebra rules for fractions really are consequences of the basic properties of multiplication.
    Recognizing these connections and using them to guide your work will help you avoid common pitfalls.
    The first key is to remember that fractions are division and therefore really multiplication.

        Each property results from the basic properties of addition.
        The following calculations emphasize these connections.
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>
            To show <m>\div(ab) = (\div a) \cdot (\div b)</m>, 
            we need to show that the property of a multiplicative inverse is satisfied.
            This requires the commutative and associative properties.
            <me>(ab) \cdot (\div a \cdot \div b) = (a \div a) \cdot (b \div b) = 1 \cdot 1 = 1</me>.
            Written in terms of fractions, this means 
            <m>\displaystyle \frac{1}{a} \cdot \frac{1}{b} = \frac{1}{ab}</m>.

    The basic properties of powers, shown below, can not be proved easily for all real numbers.
    We can motivate each property with integer powers using the properties of multiplication.
    Rational powers are more complicated and involve roots, but irrational powers are too difficult for this text.

        For integer exponents, a power means repeated multiplication 
        (similar to how multiplication by an integer means repeated addition).
        So <m>b^3 = b \cdot b \cdot b</m>.
        The product properties are just about counting.

    Addition and powers have no convenient properties.
    Many mistakes occur when students forget this and imagine that powers distribute like multiplication.
    (It doesn't!)

    <example>
      <p>
      To illustrate that <m>(a+b)^2 \ne a^2+b^2</m>, consider the numbers <m>a=2</m> and <m>b=3</m>.
      The first expression gives <me>(a+b)^2 = (2+3)^2 = 5^2 = 25</me> 
      while the second expression gives <me>a^2+b^2=2^2+3^2=4+9=13.</me> 
      The proper way to expand the first expression is to think of the power 
      as repeated multiplication and apply the distributive property.
      This is often called the <c>FOIL</c> method: 
      <me>(a+b)^2=(a+b)(a+b)=a^2+2ab+b^2</me>.

    </example>
    
    <example>
      <p>
      To illustrate that <m>\sqrt{a^2+b^2} \ne a+b</m>, again consider the numbers <m>a=2</m> and <m>b=3</m>.
      The first expression gives 
      <me>\sqrt{a^2+b^2} = \sqrt{2^2+3^2}=\sqrt{13},</me> 
      and the second expression gives <me>a+b=2+3=5.</me> 
      There is no convenient way to expand a square root.

    If you see any operation acting on a sum (e.g., powers, roots or functions), 
    unless you know a specific rule, you should not break up the formula into individual parts.
    Such rules are called sum rules and will play a very important role in calculus.

    The elementary exponential functions <m>\exp_b(x)=b^x</m> provide an interesting exception 
    to the general principle that a sum inside an operation can not be simply rewritten.
    They inherit a property from powers: <me>\exp_b(x+y) = b^{x+y} = b^x \cdot b^y</me>.
    Such a rule might be remembered as <q>the exponential of a sum is the product of exponentials</q>.
    Similarly, we have related properties for quotients and powers.

    Historically, the logarithm was invented so that multiplication and division calculations 
    could be solved using the much simpler operations of addition and subtraction.
    Engineers and scientists would often reference logarithm tables.
    The slide rule was a mechanical implementation, where the lengths 
    corresponding to logarithm values were added physically to get a new length.

        and <m>\log(5) \approx 0.69897</m>.

        Each factor of the expression inside the logarithm will get its own term 
        using the product and quotient rules for logarithms.
        If we think of every division in terms of negative powers, 
        then we only need to deal with products.
        In particular, the inner expression can be rewritten 
        <me>\frac{4x^3\sqrt{2x+5}}{(x^2+3)^5} = 4x^3(2x+5)^{\frac{1}{2}}(x^2+3)^{-5}</me>.
        The factors identified are <m>4</m>, <m>x^3</m>, <m>(2x+5)^{\frac{1}{2}}</m>, and <m>(x^2+3)^{-5}</m>.
        Using the logarithm's product rule followed by the logarithm's power rule, we find

    The properties of logarithms help solve us equations, particularly where the variable is in an exponent.
    Because inverse functions are one-to-one, we can apply such a function to both sides of an equation with positive values and form a new equation that is equivalent to the first.
    The properties of the logarithm can then be used to our advantage.

        It is usually best to isolate the exponential term first.

          <mrow> 2^{3x} = \frac{5}{3} </mrow>
        </md> 
        We next apply the logarithm base 10 to both sides of this equation, 
        which then allows us to apply the logarithm power rule on the left.
        Then we can isolate <m>x</m>.
        <md>
          <mrow> \log_{10}(2^{3x}) = \log_{10}({\textstyle \frac{5}{3}}) </mrow>

        Alternatively, we could have applied the logarithm at the very first.

      Exponential and logarithmic functions are related to the algebraic ideas of exponents and powers.
      An exponential function is a function involving powers where the power is a variable while the base is a constant.
      A logarithmic function is the inverse of an exponential function.

      Sometimes an exponential function is not written in its standard form.
      You need to know how to rewrite formulas involving exponents

          The value of <m>\log_4(32)</m> is unknown,

          (see Equation <xref ref="logarithm-exponential-equivalence"/>).
          <me> x = \log_4(32) \quad \Leftrightarrow \quad 4^x = 32 </me> 
          The next step is to recognize that 4 and 32 are both powers of 2, 
          so we rewrite the equation in terms of powers of 2: 
          <me>(2^2)^x = 2^5 \quad \Leftrightarrow \quad 2^{2x} = 2^5.</me> 
          Now that we have an equation with the same base,

          the powers must be equal, <m>2x = 5</m>,

        <p>
          The equation we are solving can be rewritten in terms of exponential functions as <me>\exp_2(3x+1) = 5.</me> 
          This new equation emphasizes that the variable expression <m>3x+1</m> is the input of an exponential.
          (It is not necessary to write this fact, just to recognize it.) 
          The logarithm <m>\log_2</m> is the inverse of <m>\exp_2</m>, 
          which in composition with one another yields the identity <me>\log_2(2^{3x+1}) = 3x+1.</me> 
          Applying this operation to both sides of the original equation, we have 
          <me>\log_2(2^{3x+1}) = \log_2(5) \quad \Leftrightarrow \quad 3x+1 = \log_2(5).</me> 
          The expression <m>\log_2(5)</m> is just a value, so we can solve for <m>x</m>, 
          <me>x = \frac{\log_2(5) - 1}{3},</me> giving us our desired solution.

      It is most useful to remember the properties of logarithms conceptually.
      For example, Equation <xref ref="logarithm-of-product"/> states 
      that the logarithm of a product is equivalent to the sum of the logarithms of the factors.
      Similarly, Equation <xref ref="logarithm-of-quotient"/> states 
      that the logarithm of a quotient is equivalent to the difference of the logarithms 
      (and the logarithm of the denominator is subtracted).
      Finally, Equation <xref ref="logarithm-of-power"/> states 
      that the logarithm of a value raised to a power is equivalent 
      to the product of the power times the logarithm of the value.

      Although there are valid logarithm functions for every base <m>b \gt 0</m> with <m>b \ne 1</m>, 
      calculators generally have only two specific bases.
      The <term>common logarithm</term> refers to the logarithm with base <m>b=10</m> 
      and is chosen to be conveniently related to scientific notation.
      The <term>natural logarithm</term> refers to the logarithm with base <m>b=e</m> (a special transcendental number).
      These two logarithms have their own special notation.
      The common logarithm (base 10) is often written without any base,

          or if we choose <m>a=10</m> (common base),

      The strategy to prove these formulas is the same as would be used 
      to solve an equation with logarithms in terms of the natural or common logarithm.
    </p>
    
    <example>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Solve the equation <m>2^{3x} = 5</m> in terms of the natural logarithm.
          (Note that this is equivalent to solving <m>8^x=5</m> or <m>x=\log_8(5)</m>.)
        </p>
      </statement>
      <solution>
        <p>
          Starting with the equation involving the exponential, 
          we will apply the natural logarithm (as asked in the problem) to both sides of the equation.
          <me> 2^{3x}=5 \quad \Leftrightarrow \quad \ln(2^{3x}) = \ln(5)</me> 
          The left side of the equation is the logarithm of a power, 
          so we can use the corresponding logarithm property (Equation <xref ref="logarithm-of-power"/>) to say 
          <me> \ln(2^{3x}) = 3x \cdot \ln(2) = \ln(5).</me> 
          Dividing both sides of the equation by the product <m>3 \ln(2)</m> 
          we find <me> x = \frac{\ln(5)}{3 \ln(2)}</me> 
          which matches what we would get using the change of base formula 
          since <m>3 \ln(2) = \ln(2^3) = \ln(8)</m> (using Equation <xref ref="logarithm-of-power"/>.)

        Properties of exponential and logarithm functions relate sums and products: 
        <ul>
          <li>
            The exponential of a sum is equivalent to a product of exponentials.
            <me>b^{x+y} = b^x \cdot b^y</me>
          </li>
          <li>
            The exponential of a difference is equivalent to a quotient of exponentials.
            <me>b^{x-y} = b^x \div b^y</me>
          </li>
          <li>
            The logarithm of a product is equivalent to the sum of logarithms.
            <me>\log_b(uv) = \log_b(u) + \log_b(v)</me>
          </li>
          <li>
            The logarithm of a quotient is equivalent to the difference of logarithms.
            <me>\log_b(u \div v) = \log_b(u) - \log_b(v)</me>
          </li>
          <li>
            The logarithm of a base to a power is equivalent to the product of the power and the logarithm of the base.
            <me>\log_b(u^p) =  p \cdot \log_b(u)</me>

        Chemistry texts often give a formula for the mass <m>M</m> of radioactively decaying element 
        in terms of the half-life, <me>M=M_0 e^{-\ln(2)t/\tau_{\frac12}}</me>, 
        where <m>M_0</m> is the mass at time <m>t=0</m> and <m>\tau_{\frac12}</m> is the half-life.
        Use the properties of exponentials and logarithms to show that this is equivalent to 
        <me>M = M_0 \cdot \Big(\frac{1}{2}\Big)^{t/\tau_{\frac12}}</me>.
