  We close this subsection to illustrate that not all numbers are rational.
  Thanks to Pythagorus, the ancient Greeks knew that <m>\sqrt{2}</m> was a number
  that represented the hypotenuse of an isosceles right triangle with legs of unit length.
  However, they originally thought that all numbers would ultimately be rational numbers.
  Realizing that <m>\sqrt{2}</m> was irrational was so shocking that, according to legend,
  the discoverer of this fact was drowned at sea.
</p>
<example>
  <statement>
    <p>
      The basic argument is to consider a rational number that <em>might</em> represent <m>\sqrt{2}</m>
      and then proceed to show that such a representation doesn't make sense.
      The detailed argument is shown below.
    </p>
  </statement>
  <solution>
    <p>
      Suppose that <m>\sqrt{2}</m> is a rational number.
      Then it can be written as the ratio of two integers <m>\sqrt{2} = \frac{p}{q}</m> in reduced form,
      meaning <m>p</m> and <m>q</m> do not have common factors.
      By definition of square roots, we must have <m>\frac{p^2}{q^2} = 2</m> which implies <me>p^2 = 2 q^2</me>
      so that <m>p^2</m> is an even number.
      The only way that <m>p^2</m> can be even is if <m>p</m> itself is even,
      since the product of two odd numbers is always odd.
    </p>
    <p>
      Once we know <m>p</m> is even, we can factor out 2 and write <m>p=2k</m> where <m>k</m> is also an integer.
      Now <m>p^2 = 4k^2</m> which implies <m>4k^2=2q^2</m> or <me>q^2 = 2k^2.</me>
      This means <m>q</m> would also be an even number.
      This is where the contradiction occurs<mdash/>since <m>p</m> and <m>q</m> were to have had no common factors,
      they couldn't both be even.
      This means that <m>\sqrt{2}</m> can not be written as a reduced fraction,
      which in turn means that <m>\sqrt{2}</m> is not a rational number.
    </p>
  </solution>
</example>

  We can think of a measurement with its given precision as representing many possible exact lengths.
  These possible lengths correspond to <term>intervals</term> on the number line.
  On a ruler measuring in centimeters, all lengths between 14.5 and 15.5 centimeters would be represented by the measurement of 15 centimeters.
  Consequently, a measurement of 15 cm corresponds to the interval of possible lengths <m>[14.5,15.5)</m> (centimeters).
  We include the left end-point because we round the digit 5 up, and an exact length of 15.5 would round up to 16.
  (We'd actually have a hard time knowing exactly where those lengths are because of measurement error;
  we should probably flip a coin if we can't decide which side is closer.)

  Similarly, if the ruler showed millimeters, all lengths between 15.25 and 15.35 centimeters would be represented by the measurement of 15.3 centimeters.
  A measurement of 15.3 cm then corresponds to the interval <m>[15.25,15.35)</m> (centimeters).

<p>
  Significant digits with zeros have some trickier rules.
  For example, in the previous example,
  if the length were reported in microns instead of centimeters,
  the two significant digit result would be 150,000 microns.
  The zeros following the 5 are only present as placeholders to maintain the appropriate  magnitude.
  To avoid any confusion, <term>scientific notation</term> would be best,
  writing this as <m>1.5 \times 10^5</m> microns.
  Zeros following the decimal point are considered significant.
  So a measurement of <m>2.530 \times 10^4</m> would have four significant digits
  but <m>2.53 \times 10^4</m> would only have three significant digits.
</p>

<p>
  When measurements are given with margins of error,
  dependent quantities calculated from them also have margins of error.
  Those errors need to be computed based on the margins of error that we know.
  One of the outcomes from calculus is understanding the relationships between these margins of error.
</p>

<example>
  <statement>
    <p>
      Suppose that we have a square whose length is side <m>s</m>.
      From measurement, we have <m>s = 5.3 \pm 0.025</m> <quantity><unit prefix="centi" base="meter"/></quantity>.
      What are the possible values for the perimeter <m>P</m> and the area <m>A</m>?
      Write them using a margin of error.
    </p>
  </statement>
  <solution>
    <p>
      The perimeter is the sum of the lengths of the sides.
      For a square, we have <m>P = 4s</m>.
      Because our measurement for <m>s</m> is <m>\widehat{s} = 5.3</m> <quantity><unit prefix="centi" base="meter"/></quantity>,
      our estimate of the perimeter is <m>\widehat{P} = 4(5.3) = 21.2</m> <quantity><unit prefix="centi" base="meter"/></quantity>.
    </p>
    <p>
      This does not capture the margin of error.
      A common mistake is to use the same margin of error as we had for <m>s</m>.
      A better approach is to think about the entire range of possible values.
      The smallest possible value for <m>s</m> would be <m>s=5.3-0.025 = 5.275</m> <quantity><unit prefix="centi" base="meter"/></quantity>.
      Using that value, the perimeter would be <m>P=4(5.275) = 21.1</m> <quantity><unit prefix="centi" base="meter"/></quantity>.
      Similarly, the largest possible value for <m>s</m> would be <m>s=5.3+0.025 = 5.325</m> <quantity><unit prefix="centi" base="meter"/></quantity>.
      Using this value, the perimeter would be <m>P=4(5.325) = 21.3</m> <quantity><unit prefix="centi" base="meter"/></quantity>.
      The true perimeter must be a value in the range <m>21.1 \lt P \lt 21.3</m>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Using the estimate <m>\widehat{P} = 21.2</m>, we measure the distance to each edge of the possible range.
      Both edges are a distance 0.1 away from the estimate, so we can write
      <m>P = 21.2 \pm 0.1</m> <quantity><unit prefix="centi" base="meter"/></quantity>.
      What do you notice about the margin of error for <m>P</m> in comparison to the margin of error for <m>s</m>?
    </p>
    <p>
      The area of a square is the square of the length of its side, <m>A = s^2</m>.
      Using the measurement <m>\widehat{s} = 5.3</m> <quantity><unit prefix="centi" base="meter"/></quantity>,
      we obtain an estimate <m>\widehat{A} = (5.3)^2 = 28.09</m> <quantity><unit prefix="centi" base="meter" exp="2"/></quantity>.
      To find the margin of error, we first need to consider the range of possible values.
      Using the smallest possible side <m>s = 5.275</m> <quantity><unit prefix="centi" base="meter"/></quantity>,
      we obtain an area <m>A = 27.825625</m> <quantity><unit prefix="centi" base="meter" exp="2"/></quantity>.
      The largest square gives <m>A = 28.355625</m> <quantity><unit prefix="centi" base="meter" exp="2"/></quantity>.
      We now know <m>27.825625 \lt A \lt 28.355625</m>.
    </p>
    <p>
      To consider the margin of error, we need to measure the distance
      from the estimate <m>\widehat{A} = 28.09</m> to each edge of the range.
      <md>
        <mrow>| 27.825625 - 28.09 | = 0.264375 </mrow>
        <mrow>| 28.355625 - 28.09 | = 0.265625 </mrow>
      </md>
      We can see that the range of possible values is not symmetric around the estimate.
      The margin of error will be the <em>largest</em> distance to an edge:
      <me>| A - 28.09 | \lt 0.265625</me>.

  Solving equations has a graphical interpretation.
  Recall that an equation is a statement that two expressions are equal.
  We can imagine that each expression defines a dependent variable, say <m>y_1</m> and <m>y_2</m>.
  A solution would be where the dependent variables have the same value, <m>y_1=y_2</m>.
  Graphically, that would be where the curves defined by the dependent variables cross.
</p>
<example>
  <statement>
    <p>
      The equation <m>2x^2=3x+5</m> can be interpreted as having two dependent variables,
      <md>
        <mrow>y_1 &amp;= 2x^2,</mrow>
        <mrow>y_2 &amp;= 3x+5.</mrow>
      </md>
      We can plot a graph of each equation in the same figure.
      The first dependent variable <m>y_1</m> corresponds to a parabola
      and the second dependent variable <m>y_2</m> corresponds to a line.
      Points where the graphs cross correspond to solutions.

      The original equation only involved the independent variable <m>x</m>.
      Consequently, the solution set corresponds to the set of the <m>x</m>-coordinates of the points of intersection.
      That is, the solution set is <m>\{-1, \frac{5}{2}\}</m>.

When the phenomenon is considered under a single environmental condition,
the measurements relating to that condition which do not change are called <term>state parameters</term>.
From a mathematical perspective, both state variables and state parameters are variables.
Often the equations involve additional coefficients or constants.
These constants are called <term>model parameters</term>.

  <title>Systems of Equations and Constraints</title>
  <p>
    An equation involving multiple variables establishes a relation between the variables.
    We often have multiple equations, each of which constrains the possible values for the variables.
    A useful strategy for solving equations is to isolate a dependent variable in one equation
    and then substitute the resulting value or formula into the other equation.
    That equation then has one variable which can be solved using the usual methods.
  </p>
  <example>
    <statement>
      <p>
        The equation <me>u^2+v^2=16+6u</me> forms a relation between variables <m>u</m> and <m>v</m>.
        <ul>
          <li>Find the possible values for <m>v</m> when <m>u=-1</m>.</li>
          <li>Find the possible values for <m>u</m> when <m>v=2</m>.</li>
          <li>Find the possible values for <m>u</m> and <m>v</m> when <m>u=v</m>.</li>
        </ul>
      </p>
    </statement>
    <solution>
      <p>
        First, to solve the equation when <m>u=-1</m>, we substitute the value of <m>u=-1</m>
        and then use algebra to isolate <m>v</m>.
        <md>
          <mrow>u^2+v^2=16+6u</mrow>
          <mrow>(-1)^2+v^2 = 16 + 6(-1)</mrow>
          <mrow>1+v^2=10</mrow>
          <mrow>v^2=9</mrow>
          <mrow>v=\pm 3</mrow>
        </md>
        There are two values for <m>v</m> when <m>u=-1</m>.
        The solutions are the states <m>(u,v)=(-1,3)</m> and <m>(u,v)=(-1,-3)</m>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Next, to solve the equation when <m>v=2</m>, we substitute the value <m>v=2</m>.
        However, because <m>u</m> appears in the equation with terms <m>u^2</m> and <m>6u</m>, we can not combine terms to isolate <m>u</m>.
        Instead, we need to use the <xref ref="thm-quadratic-formula" text="title">quadratic formula</xref>.
        <md>
          <mrow>u^2+v^2=16+6u</mrow>
          <mrow>u^2+(2)^2 = 16 + 6u</mrow>
          <mrow>u^2+4=16+6u</mrow>
          <mrow>u^2-6u-12=0</mrow>
          <mrow>u=\frac{6 \pm \sqrt{(-6)^2-4(-12)}}{2}</mrow>
          <mrow>u=\frac{6 \pm \sqrt{84}}{2} = \frac{6 \pm 2\sqrt{21}}{2}</mrow>
          <mrow>u=3 \pm \sqrt{21}</mrow>
        </md>
        Again, two states are solutions, <m>(u,v)=(3+\sqrt{21},2)</m> and <m>(u,v)=(3-\sqrt{21},2)</m>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Finally, the equation <m>u=v</m> is a constraint involving both variables.
        Because <m>v</m> is shown as a dependent variable in the constraint <m>v=u</m>,
        we substitute <m>u</m> in place of <m>v</m> in the original equation.
        <md>
          <mrow>u^2+v^2=16+6u</mrow>
          <mrow>u^2+(u)^2 = 16 + 6u</mrow>
          <mrow>2u^2-6u-16=0</mrow>
          <mrow>u^2-3u-8=0</mrow>
          <mrow>u=\frac{3 \pm \sqrt{(-3)^2-4(1)(-8)}}{2}</mrow>
          <mrow>u=\frac{3 \pm \sqrt{9+32}}{2} = \frac{3 \pm \sqrt{41}}{2}</mrow>
        </md>
        For each value of <m>u</m>, we have <m>v=u</m>.
        One solution would be <m>(u,v) = (\frac{3 + \sqrt{41}}{2},\frac{3 + \sqrt{41}}{2})</m>
        while the other solution would be <m>(u,v) = (\frac{3 - \sqrt{41}}{2},\frac{3 - \sqrt{41}}{2})</m>.
      </p>
    </solution>
  </example>
  <p>
    Equations allow us to answer questions involving variables whose relation is known.
  </p>
  <example>
    <statement>
      <p>
        Is it possible to enclose an area of 25 <quantity><unit base="meter" exp="2"/></quantity> in a rectangle with perimeter of 18 <quantity><unit base="meter"/></quantity>?
        If so, how?
      </p>
    </statement>
    <solution>
      <p>
        In this problem, we need to identify the relevant variables for the system and the equations that constrain the state.
        We are working with a rectangle, which is characterized by a length and a width.
        Let us draw a figure and use variables <m>L</m> for the length and <m>W</m> for the width.

      </sidebyside>
      <p>
        The perimeter <m>P</m> and the area <m>A</m> can be considered to be dependent variables,
        defined by the equations
        <md>
          <mrow>P=2L+2W,</mrow>
          <mrow>A=L \cdot W.</mrow>
        </md>
        The problem gives us two additional pieces of information, <m>P=18</m> and <m>A=25</m>.
        When we substitute those values of the state into the equations, we have two equations for two variables:
        <me>2L+2W=18, \qquad L \cdot W = 25.</me>
        In order to solve these equations, we use one equation to isolate one of the variables,
        say <m>L</m>, and then substitute the resulting expression into the other equation.
        <md>
          <mrow>2L+2W=18 \qquad \Rightarrow \qquad L=9-W</mrow>
          <mrow>L\cdot W = 25 \qquad \Rightarrow \qquad (9-W)W = 25</mrow>
        </md>
        Then we solve the equation that only involves <m>W</m>.
        <md>
          <mrow>(9-W)W = 25</mrow>
          <mrow>9W-W^2=25</mrow>
          <mrow>W^2-9W+25=0</mrow>
          <mrow>W=\frac{9 \pm \sqrt{(-9)^2-4(25)}}{2}</mrow>
          <mrow>W=\frac{9 \pm \sqrt{81-100}}{2}=\frac{9\pm \sqrt{-19}}{2}</mrow>
        </md>
        When solving this quadratic formula, we have the square-root of a negative number giving complex numbers.
      </p>
      <p>
        In conclusion, we found that there are no real solutions.
        This means that it is not possible to create a rectangle with a perimeter of 18 <quantity><unit base="meter"/></quantity> and an area of 25 <quantity><unit base="meter" exp="2"/></quantity>.

  <title>Inverse Questions for Sequences</title>
  <p>
    In our discussions about sequences, we introduced two maps.
    The first was in relation to an explicit definition of a sequence,
    where we mapped from the index to the sequence value, <m>n \mapsto x_n</m>.
    The second was in relation to a recursive definition of a sequence by a projection function, <m>x_{n-1} \mapsto x_{n}</m>.
    The inverse map for these functions can help answer interesting questions for sequences.
  </p>
  <example>
    <statement>
      <p>
        Suppose you start with one cent.
        Each day your money doubles.
        When will you have a million dollars?
      </p>
    </statement>
    <solution>
      <p>
        We start by identifying our sequence.
        We might choose the name <m>W</m> for our sequence to represent our wealth.
        Because the sequence doubles each day, our index <m>n</m> will represent the day
        and the sequence has recursive equation <m>W_{n} = 2 W_{n-1}</m>.
        This means our sequence is a geometric sequence.
        The initial value is <m>W_1 = 0.01</m> (dollars).
        We can then write down the explicit formula using <xref ref="theorem-geometric-explicit-sequence"/>,
        <me>W_n = 0.01 \cdot 2^{(n-1)}</me>.
        The properties of exponents allow us to rewrite this as an equivalent expression
        <me>W_n = 0.01 \cdot \frac{2^n}{2^1} = 0.005 \cdot 2^n</me>.
      </p>
      <p>
        The question is when the value of our wealth is a million dollars.
        That is, we want to know the day <m>n</m> when <m>W_n = 1000000</m>.
        This is an inverse function question.
        To answer a single question like this, we do not need to know the actual function.
        We can just solve for <m>n</m>, using balanced operations until <m>n</m> is isolated.
        <md>
          <mrow>W_n = 0.005 \cdot 2^n</mrow>
          <mrow>0.005 \cdot 2^n = 10^6</mrow>
          <mrow>2^n=\frac{10^6}{0.005}</mrow>
          <mrow>2^n = 2 \times 10^8</mrow>
        </md>
        On the left, we have an elementary exponential with base <m>b=2</m>.
        To isolate <m>n</m>, we need to use the logarithm with base <m>b=2</m>.
        <md>
          <mrow>\log_2( 2^n) = \log_2( 2 \times 10^8 ) </mrow>
          <mrow>n = \log_2( 2 \times 10^8 ) </mrow>
        </md>
        Using the change of base rule for logarithms, we can use a calculator to identify the value.
        <me>n = \frac{\log(2 \times 10^8)}{\log(2)} \approx 27.5754</me>
      </p>
      <p>
        We try to interpret the result.
        The value <m>n \approx 27.5754</m> is not possible an index, which must be an integer.
        That means that our wealth is never exactly a million dollars.
        We need to reinterpret the question as saying when we first <em>exceed</em> a million dollars.
        Because our solution is between <m>n=27</m> and <m>n=28</m> and the value doubles each day,
        we can see that day <m>n=27</m> will be the last day we have a wealth below a million dollars
        and that day <m>n=28</m> will be the first day when our wealth is above a million dollars.
      </p>
    </solution>
  </example>
  <example>
    <statement>
      <p>
        A population of insects is tracked weekly and found to follow a recursive model.
        We let <m>P</m> be the sequence of population measurements with an index <m>n</m> counting the number of weeks.
        The insect population follows the recurrence relation
        <me>P_{n} = 1.5 P_{n-1} - 100</me>
        with a value of <m>P_0 = 5000</m>, the population recorded for the first week of observation.
        What was the population two weeks before observations began?
      </p>
    </statement>
    <solution>
      <p>
        The recurrence relation shows that <m>P</m> is not arithmetic nor is it geometric.
        We do not yet know how to find an explicit formula.
        However, we do know the projection function <m>f : P_{n-1} \mapsto P_{n}</m>.
        The inverse of the projection function would reverse the direction of projection,
        allowing us to determine the preceding value of the sequence instead of the subsequent value.
      </p>
      <p>
        We find the inverse function (the reverse projection function) by solving the recurrent relation for <m>P_n</m>.
        <md>
          <mrow>P_{n} = 1.5 P_{n-1} - 100</mrow>
          <mrow>P_{n} + 100 = 1.5 P_{n-1} = \frac{3}{2} P_{n-1}</mrow>
          <mrow>\frac{2}{3}(P_{n} + 100) = P_{n-1}</mrow>
        </md>
        Consequently, the inverse projection function is <m>f^{-1}(x) = \frac{2}{3}(x+100)</m>.
      </p>
      <p>
        With the inverse projection function, we can work the sequence backwards from the initial value.
        Starting with <m>P_0 = 5000</m>, we find
        <md>
          <mrow>P_{-1} = f^{-1}(5000) = \frac{2}{3}(5000+100) = 3400</mrow>
          <mrow>P_{-2} = f^{-1}(3400) = \frac{2}{3}(3400+100) = \frac{7000}{3}</mrow>
        </md>
        The exact value from our model is <m>P_{-2} \approx 2333\frac{1}{3}</m>.
        Even though a population has integer values and this prediction is definitely not an integer,
        we would report our model value unless we had information on how many significant digits to keep.

  <statement>
    <p>
      Express the functions <m>x \mapsto 4-x</m> and <m>x \mapsto 4 \div x</m> as compositions of elementary arithmetic operations.
    </p>
  </statement>
  <solution>
    <p>
      We start with the function <m>x \mapsto 4-x</m>.
      The negation of a number is always equal to that number times <m>-1</m><mdash/>a constant multiple,
      <me>f_1(x) = -1 x</me>.
      Because <m>4-x = -x + 4</m>, we can see that we take the output of <m>f_1</m>
      and apply the elementary arithmetic operation of adding 4,
      <me>f_2(x) = x+4</me>.
      The function is question is the composition,
      <me>f_2 \circ f_1(x) = f_2(-x) = -x + 4 = 4-x</me>.
    </p>
    <p>
      For the second function, <m>x \mapsto 4 \div x</m>, we recall <m>4 \div x = 4 \cdot \frac{1}{x}</m>.
      Our first elementary operation is the reciprocal,
      <me>g_1(x) = \frac{1}{x}</me>.
      We then multiply by the constant 4,
      <me>g_2(x) = 4x</me>.
      Our function is the composition
      <me>g_2 \circ g_1(x) = g_2(\frac{1}{x}) = 4 \cdot \frac{1}{x} = \frac{4}{x}</me>.
    </p>
  </solution>
</example>
<p>
  We can construct fairly complex operations by composition of various elementary operations.
  Our ability to recognize compositions will be very important in calculus,
  so we take advantage of this opportunity to develop this skill.
</p>
<example>
  <statement>
    <p>
      Express <m>\displaystyle x \mapsto 3 + \frac{4}{2x-5}</m> as a composition of elementary arithmetic operations.
    </p>
  </statement>
  <solution>
    <p>
      We start by looking for the variable <m>x</m> in the formula.
      Using the order of operations, we state in words (at least in our minds) what happens to that value.
      <ul>
        <li>Start with <m>x</m>.</li>
        <li>Multiply by 2.</li>
        <li>Subtract 5, or, in other words, add <m>-5</m>.</li>
        <li>Divide 4 by the result.</li>
        <li>Add 3.</li>
      </ul>
      The step where we divide 4 by the result is not an elementary operation.
      We break it into two steps: (i) find the reciprocal and (ii) multiply by 4.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now that each step is an elementary operation, we can state our composition.
      First, we define the relevant functions, one for each step.
      <md>
        <mrow>f_1(x)=2x</mrow>
        <mrow>f_2(x)=x+-5</mrow>
        <mrow>f_3(x)=\frac{1}{x}</mrow>
        <mrow>f_4(x)=4x</mrow>
        <mrow>f_5(x)=x+3</mrow>
      </md>
      Our function is the composition
      <me>f_5 \circ f_4 \circ f_3 \circ f_2 \circ f_1(x) = 4 \cdot \frac{2x+-5}+3</me>.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is common for learners to be confused by the functions used in composition.
      For example, many learners think that <m>f_2(x)</m> should have been <m>2x+-5</m>.
      Remember that the function representing the operation describes what happens to its input
      and does not take into account what we might separately know will become the input.
      The composition of the first two operations would be <m>f_2 \circ f_1(x) = 2x+-5</m>.
      It might be helpful to use a different placeholder for the input.
      We could have written <m>\square</m> as a placeholder for the input of subsequent operations
      to remind us that the operation acts on the input and not on the <m>x</m> of the ultimate formula.
      <md>
        <mrow>f_1(x)=2x</mrow>
        <mrow>f_2(\square)=\square+-5</mrow>
        <mrow>f_3(\square)=\frac{1}{\square}</mrow>
        <mrow>f_4(\square)=4\square</mrow>
        <mrow>f_5(\square)=\square+3</mrow>

  When a function can be represented as a composition of elementary arithmetic operations,
  the inverse function can easily be found by the reverse composition of inverse arithmetic operations.
  <ul>
    <li>The inverse of a constant sum operation is another sum with the negation of that constant.</li>
    <li>The inverse of a constant multiple operation is another multiple with the inverse or reciprocal of that constant. (Multiplying by zero can not be inverted.)</li>
    <li>The inverse of a reciprocal operation is to apply the reciprocal operation again.</li>
  </ul>
</p>
<example>
  <statement>
    <p>Find the inverse function for <m>\displaystyle f(x)=\frac{4}{2x-5}+3</m>.</p>
  </statement>
  <solution>
    <p>
      In the previous example, we identified that <m>f(x)</m> was a composition of the following operations,
      starting with the input <m>x</m>:
      <ol>
        <li>Multiply by 2.</li>
        <li>Add <m>-5</m>.</li>
        <li>Reciprocal.</li>
        <li>Multiply by 4.</li>
        <li>Add 3.</li>
      </ol>
      The inverse function must apply the inverse operations in the reverse order.
      <ol>
        <li>Add <m>-3</m>.</li>
        <li>Multiply by <m>\frac{1}{4}</m>.</li>
        <li>Reciprocal.</li>
        <li>Add 5.</li>
        <li>Multiply by <m>\frac{1}{2}</m>.</li>
      </ol>
      The composition of these operations gives us an inverse function,
      <me>f^{-1}(x) = \frac{1}{2}\Big(\frac{1}{\frac{1}{4}(x+-3)}+5\Big)</me>.
      We can rewrite this expression in a simpler equivalent form.
      We can simplify the fraction within a fraction by recognizing <m>\frac{1}{4}(x+-3) = \frac{x-3}{4}</m>
      and then finding the reciprocal:
      <md>
        <mrow>f^{-1}(x) &amp;= \frac{1}{2}\Big(\frac{1}{\big(\frac{x-3}{4}\big)}+5\Big)</mrow>
        <mrow> &amp;= \frac{1}{2}\Big(\frac{4}{x-3}+5\Big).</mrow>
      </md>
      If we wanted to distribute the multiplication by <m>\frac{1}{2}</m>,
      we would obtain a slightly simpler expression,
      <me>f^{-1}(x) = \frac{2}{x-3} + \frac{5}{2}</me>.

<example>
  <statement>
    <p>
      A chemical reaction is tracked with concentrations measured every five minutes.
      The concentration of one reactant is predicted to follow an exponential decay.
      Let <m>R</m> be the concentration of that reactant in moles per liter as a function of time <m>t</m> in minutes.
      When <m>t=0</m>, the concentration was <m>R=2.5</m>.
      When <m>t=5</m>, the concentration was <m>R=2.1</m>.
      At what time will the concentration be <m>R=1.0</m>?
    </p>
  </statement>
  <solution>
    <p>
      This question is a bit more challenging as it will involve several stages.
      We begin by looking at the question.
      We want to find the time <m>t</m> knowing the concentration <m>R</m>.
      That is, we would like to apply a map <m>R \mapsto t</m> which would be the inverse of <m>t \mapsto R</m>.
      To find our answer, we will first need to write <m>R</m> as a dependent variable with <m>t</m> as the independent variable.
    </p>
    <p>
      Next, we look at the given information to see what it says about the relation <m>f: t \mapsto R</m>.
      Because the problem states that the reactant follows exponential decay,
      we interpret this as telling us that <m>R = f(t)</m> is an exponential function.
      The general exponential function has the form
      <me>f(t) = A \cdot b^{t}</me>
      where <m>A</m> and <m>b</m> are the model parameters (constants).
    </p>
    <p>
      We use the given information to determine the values of <m>A</m> and <m>b</m>.
      Each state will give us an equation that can be used to constrain the values of the parameters.
      The state <m>(t,R) = (0,2.5)</m> corresponds to the equation <m>f(0) = 2.5</m>.
      The exponential function applied to this equation gives
      <me>f(0) = A \cdot b^0 = A \qquad \Rightarrow \qquad A = 2.5</me>.
      The state <m>(t,R) = (5,2.1)</m> corresponds to the equation <m>f(5)=2.1</m>,
      which gives an equation
      <me>f(5) = A \cdot b^5 \qquad \Rightarrow \qquad A \cdot b^5 = 2.1</me>.
      Substituting <m>A=2.5</m> into the second equation, we can then solve for <m>b</m>.
      <md>
        <mrow>2.5 \cdot b^5 = 2.1</mrow>
        <mrow>b^5 = \frac{2.1}{2.5} = 0.84</mrow>
      </md>
      The inverse operation of a power <m>p=5</m> is a fifth-root or a power <m>p=\frac{1}{5}</m>.
      <me>b = \sqrt[5]{0.84} = 0.84^{1/5} \approx 0.96573</me>
      We will use the exact value.
    </p>
    <p>
      Knowing <m>A=2.5</m> and <m>b = 0.84^{1/5}</m>, we have our function <m>f : t \mapsto R</m>,
      <me>R = f(t) = 2.5 \cdot (0.84^{1/5})^{t} = 2.5 \cdot 0.84^{t/5}.</me>
      The inverse function <m>f^{-1} : R \mapsto t</m> can be used to take a concentration and report back a time.
      We need to solve the equation for <m>t</m> as the dependent variable.
      When choosing what operation to apply an inverse, we first need to isolate the exponential.
      <md>
        <mrow>R = 2.5 \cdot 0.84^{t/5}</mrow>
        <mrow>\frac{R}{2.5} = 0.84^{t/5}</mrow>
      </md>
      We now have an exponential with base <m>b=0.84</m> on the right.
      The balanced inverse operation would be to use a logarithm with <m>b=0.84</m> on both sides.
      <md>
        <mrow>\log_{0.84}(\frac{R}{2.5}) = \frac{t}{5}</mrow>
        <mrow>5 \log_{0.84}(\frac{R}{2.5}) = t</mrow>
      </md>
      We finish by using the change of base formula for logarithms:
      <me>t = 5 \cdot \frac{\log(R/2.5)}{\log(0.84)}</me>.
    </p>
    <p>
      To answer the question, we use the inverse relation with <m>R=1.0</m> and compute <m>t</m>.
      <md>
        <mrow>t &amp;= 5 \cdot \frac{\log(1.0/2.5)}{\log(0.84)}</mrow>
        <mrow>&amp;= 5 \cdot \frac{\log(0.4)}{\log(0.84)}</mrow>
        <mrow>&amp;\approx 26.277</mrow>
      </md>
      The concentration will be <m>R=1.0</m> approximately 26.277 minutes after the experiment begins.
