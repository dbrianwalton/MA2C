  <title>An Overview of Calculus</title>

  <introduction>
    <p>
      The <xref ref="chapter-sequences">previous chapter</xref> studied sequences.
      There are three major concepts in calculus that we can use sequences to motivate.
      These are limits, derivatives, and integrals.
    </p>
    <p>
      In this chapter, we will focus on the idea of the definite integral
      as a generalization of accumulating increments of change.
      Thinking of sequences in terms of their increments of change is simpler
      because the domain consists only of integers which are equally spaced.
      More general functions are defined with domains consisting of intervals of the real numbers.
      (Some functions can be defined on even more complex sets, which gives rise to even more advanced mathematics.)
      Consequently, we can not think only in terms of increments of change
      but in terms of a <term>rate of change</term>.
    </p>
  </introduction>

  <subsection>
    <title>Limits</title>
    <p>
      For sequences, we introduced the idea of limits as the value the sequence was approaching
      further and further in that sequence.
      We saw that the decimal approximations of the sequence values would eventually converge
      to the decimal approximation of the limiting value.
      The mathematical definition of the limit was stated in terms of the possibility of
      eventually waiting long enough in the sequence that the sequence values would approximate the limit value
      within <em>any</em> desired accuracy of approximation.
    </p>
    <p>
      The only limits of interest in sequences were when the index went to infinity.
      For functions, in order to <xref ref="defn-limit-intuition">understand continuity</xref>, 
      we have found that we also need to think about limits 
      as the independent variable approaches a value from either the left or the right.
      Sequences can give us a way to think about this possibility.
    </p>
    <definition xml:id="definition-limit-by-sequences">
      <title>Limits of Function</title>
      <statement>
        <p>
          For a function <m>f</m> defined on intervals to the left and right of <m>c</m>,
          we say <me>\lim_{x \to c} f(x) = L</me> to mean that
          for <em>every</em> independent sequence <m>x</m> such that <m>x_n \ne c</m> and <m>x_n \to c</m>,
          the dependent sequence <m>y = \left(f(x_n)\right)_{n=n_0}^{\infty}</m> must have the limit <m>L</m>,
          <me>\lim_{n \to \infty} f(x_n).</me>
          One-sided limits add constraints to the independent sequences, with <m>x \to c^+</m> requiring <m>x_n \gt c</m>
          and <m>x \to c^-</m> requiring <m>x_n \lt c</m>.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </definition>
    <p>
      Function limits are properties of the function itself and do not depend on the sequences chosen.
      If different independent sequences that converge to <m>c</m> result in different limits for the dependent sequence,
      then the function does not have a limit.
      The following example illustrates how this new definition relates our earlier concept 
      of continuity of piecewise functions with the sequence definition of function limits.
    </p>
    <example>
      <statement>
        <p>
          A function is defined piecewise as
          <me>f(x) = \begin{cases}
          x+2, &amp; x\lt 3, \\
          4x-x^2, &amp; x \gt 3.
          \end{cases}</me>
          Find <m>\displaystyle \lim_{x \to 3^-} f(x)</m>, <m>\displaystyle \lim_{x \to 3^+} f(x)</m>,
          and <m>\displaystyle \lim_{x \to 3} f(x)</m>.
        </p>
      </statement>
      <solution>
        <p>
          The left-sided limit needs to consider an independent sequence <m>x_n \lt 3</m> with <m>x_n \to 3</m>.
          The following partial table illustrates an example with <m>x_n = 3 - 10^{-n}</m>.

          If we compare the values of the dependent sequence <m>f(x_n)</m>

          If we compare the values of the dependent sequence <m>f(x_n)</m> 
          with the value of the formula <m>4x-x^2</m> evaluated at <m>x=3</m>, which is <m>4x-x^2=3</m>,
          we can see that the dependent sequence is approaching that limit <m>f(x_n) \to 3</m>.
          We therefore write <me>\lim_{x \to 3^+} f(x) = 3</me>.
        </p>
        <p>
          The two-sided limit requires only <m>x_n \to 3</m>.
          The sequence values might be either above or below 3.
          Above, we found that when the independent variable values are on the left <m>x_n \lt 3</m>,
          we had <m>f(x_n) \to 5</m>.
          But when <m>x_n \gt 3</m>, we had <m>f(x_n) \to 3</m>.
          Because different sequences with <m>x_n \to 3</m> result in different limits for <m>f(x_n)</m>,
          <me>\lim_{x \to 3} f(x) \text{ does not exist}.</me>
        </p>
      </solution>
    </example>

    <p>
      While the previous example attempted to connect our simpler understanding of limits
      with the limits of sequences, the given solution really only illustrated two 
      out of infinitely many possible independent sequences.
      We still need a mechanism that will prove that these two intuitive ideas actually agree.
    </p>
  </subsection>

  <subsection>
    <title>Derivatives and Integrals</title>
    
    <p>
      For sequences, we learned to think of complementary ideas of accumulation sequences and increments.
      With a sequence <m>x</m>, we had a forward difference
      <me>\Delta x_n = x_{n+1} - x_n</me>
      and a backward difference
      <me>\nabla x_n = x_n - x_{n-1}</me>.
      These differences measure the change in the sequence <m>x</m> for consecutive values of the index,
      which plays the role of the independent variable.
    </p>
    <p>
      For functions defined on intervals, there is no meaning to <em>consecutive</em> values of the independent variable.
      Near a point of interest <m>x=c</m>, there are infinitely many other values close to <m>c</m>.
      Consequently, when measuring the change of a function <m>\Delta f</m>, 
      we must also specify the change in the independent variable <m>\Delta x</m>.
      Consider two values for the independent variable, say <m>x=a</m> and <m>x=b</m>,
      and we define <m>\Delta x = b-a</m> and <m>\Delta f = f(b) - f(a)</m>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Different increments <m>\Delta x</m> will usually result in different function increments <m>\Delta f</m>.
      However, for many functions, the ratio <m>\Delta f / \Delta x</m>, called the <term>average rate of change</term>, has a limit as <m>\Delta x \to 0</m>.
      This limiting rate of change is called the <term>instantaneous rate of change</term>
      and in calculus is named the <term>derivative</term>.
    </p>
    <definition xml:id="defn-instantaneous-rate-of-change">
      <title>Instantaneous Rate of Change</title>
      <statement>
      <p>
        Given a function <m>f</m> that relates variables <m>x \overset{f}\mapsto y</m>,
        the <term>instantaneous rate of change</term> of <m>y</m> with respect to <m>x</m>
        is the <term>derivative</term> <m>\displaystyle \frac{dy}{dx}</m> defined by
        <me>\frac{dy}{dx} = \lim_{\Delta x \to 0} \frac{\Delta f}{\Delta x} = \lim_{\Delta x \to 0} \frac{f(x+\Delta x) - f(x)}{\Delta x},</me>
        if the limit exists. Consequently, for sufficiently small increments <m>\Delta x</m>,
        we have <me>\Delta f \approx \frac{dy}{dx} \cdot \Delta x</me>.
      </p>
      </statement>
    </definition>
    <p>
      The following example illustrates the role of the instantaneous rate of change 
      to relate the increments of the independent variable with the increments of the dependent variable.
    </p>
    <example>
      <statement>
        <p>
          A ball dropped from a tower has a height <m>h</m> (measured in feet) modeled 
          as a function of time <m>t</m> (measured in seconds) given by
          <me>t \overset{f}\mapsto h = 40 - 16t^2.</me>
          At <m>t=1</m>, the instantaneous rate of change is <m>\displaystyle \frac{dh}{dt} = -32</m>.
        </p>
        <p>
          This rate of change is illustrated in the dynamic figure below.
          Thinking of <m>t_0=1</m> as one value of the independent variable, 
          you can adjust the second value <m>t_1</m> to establish the increment <m>\Delta t=t_1-t_0</m>.
          The function automatically computes <m>f(1)</m> and <m>f(t_1)</m> and shows <m>\Delta h = f(t_1)-f(1)</m>.
          The ratio <m>\Delta h/\Delta t</m> will be close to 
          <quantity><mag>-32</mag><unit base="foot"/><per base="second"/></quantity>
          for small values of <m>\Delta t</m>.

        <p>
          We can recover this instantaneous rate of change using limits, as shown in the solution below.
        </p>
      </statement>
      <solution>
        <p>
          We know that <m>\Delta t = t_1 - 1</m> and <m>\Delta h = f(t_1)-f(1)</m>.
          Using the formula, this gives
          <me>\Delta h = (40-16t_1^2) - (40-16(1)^2) = -16(t_1^2 - 1)</me>.
          The average rate of change is defined by the quotient
          <me>\frac{\Delta h}{\Delta t} = \frac{-16(t_1^2-1}{t_1-1}</me>,
          which has a value for all <m>t_1 \ne 1</m>.
        </p>
        <p>
          The instantaneous rate of change is the limit of the average rate of change
          as <m>\Delta t \to 0</m>, which in this case requires <m>t_1 \to 1</m>.
          Even though the quotient is not defined at <m>t_1=1</m>, 
          we can simplify the formula used on the sides to a formula that is defined.

            <mrow>\frac{dh}{dt} = \lim_{\Delta t \to 0} \frac{\Delta h}{\Delta t} &amp;= \lim_{t_1 \to 1} \frac{-16(t_1^2-1)}{t_1-1}</mrow>

            <mrow> &amp;= -16(1+1) = -32</mrow>
          </md>
          The key step in this limit calculation was changing the limit expression
          from one in which the formula is not continuous to a new formula.
          When the formula is continuous, we can just evaluate it at the
          point of interest.
          The variable <m>t_1</m> used in the limit could have been chosen to be any
          convenient name.
        </p>
      </solution>
    </example>
    <p>
      At this point, our emphasis is understanding that the rate of change or derivative
      measures the limiting ratio for increments of change in the value of the function 
      to corresponding increments of change in the independent variable.
      Not every function has a derivative.
      We will study the calculation of the derivative in more depth in later chapters.
    </p>
    <p>
      Computing a derivative for a given function is analogous to computing the increments of a sequence.
      The complementary calculation for sequences is to compute the
      accumulation sequence for given increments.
      That is, if <m>x=(x_n)_{n=1}^{\infty}</m> is a sequence of
      increments,
      then the accumulation sequence <m>u</m> with increments
      <m>\nabla u_n=u_n - u_{n-1} = x_n</m> and initial value
      <m>u_0</m> was written
      <me>u_n = u_0 + \sum_{k=1}^{n} x_k</me>.
    </p>
    <p>
      The calculus analogue is to be given a function that represents a rate of change and 
      use it to find a new function, the <term>accumulation function</term>, 
      that has that rate of change as its derivative.
      Suppose <m>f(x)</m> is the rate of change or derivative of a
      quantity <m>Q</m> with respect to <m>x</m>,
      <me> \frac{dQ}{dx} = f(x).</me>
      We are then interested in finding <m>Q</m> as a function of
      <m>x</m> if we know an initial value <m>Q(x_0) = Q_0</m>.
      The analogue of summation of increments is the
      <term>definite integral</term>, and we will write
      <me>Q = Q_0 +\int_{x_0}^{x} f(z) \, dz.</me>
    </p>
    <p>
      The rest of this chapter is focused on bringing meaning to the
      idea of the definite integral.
      We study definite integrals before derivatives because we have
      just studied summation and sequences.
      The calculations involved in developing the ideas of definite
      integrals apply these concepts.
      Ultimately, the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus will provide a
      connection between the definite integral and the derivative,
      showing that our two ideas of rate of change represent the same thing.

    <title>A Technological Aside</title>
    <p>
      Computational tools play an important role in the
      real-world application of mathematics.
      It is increasingly common to have a tool perform actual
      computations with the user responsible to formulate the
      appropriate problem.
    </p>
    <p>
      For example, you may have heard of the website
      <url href="http://www.wolframalpha.com/">WolframAlpha</url>.
      This site acts like a search engine for mathematical content,
      and you can enter queries like <q><c>factor x^2+3x</c></q>.
      The ability extends to calculus tools as well.
      We might have asked for our earlier example
      <q><c>derivative of 40-16t^2 at t=1</c></q>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Disadvantages of a site like WolframAlpha is that you are
      limited to a single query at a time
      and it can sometimes be hard to state precisely what you want.
      More powerful tools are available, including advanced
      programmable calculators and commercial software tools
      like Wolfram's Mathematica and MapleSoft's Maple programs.
    </p>
    <p>
      A free, but similarly powerful tool is
      <url href="http://www.sagemath.org/">SageMath</url>.
      A calculation in SageMath uses a <term>script</term>
      based on the Python programming language.
      Comments in the scripts follow the <c>#</c> symbol and are
      ignored by the computer but are useful to understand what is happening.
    </p>

    <example>
      <statement>
        <p>
          To factor the formula <m>x^2+3x</m>, we would use the
          following script.
        </p>
        <sage>
          <input>
            # Tell Sage that x is a variable
            var("x")
            # Ask Sage to factor. Include the multiplication *
            factor(x^2+3*x)
          </input>
          <output>
            (x+3)*x
          </output>
        </sage>
      </statement>
    </example>

    <example>
      <statement>
        <p>
          To find the derivative of <m>40-16t^2</m> at <m>t=1</m>,
          we would use the following script.
        </p>
        <sage>
          <input>
            # Tell Sage that t is an independent variable
            var("t")

          A container of water has a volume <m>V</m>.
          Suppose that the volume has an instantaneous rate of change
          with respect to time <m>t</m> given by 
          <me>\frac{dV}{dt}=-40+3t</me>.
          When <m>\displaystyle \frac{dV}{dt}</m> is negative,
          the volume is decreasing;
          when <m>\displaystyle \frac{dV}{dt}</m> is positive,
          the volume is increasing.
          The expression defines exactly how fast the water is
          entering or leaving the container.
          Find the volume of water as a function of time
          if <m>V=500</m> when <m>t=1</m>.
        </p>
        <p>
          The following SageMath script will start by defining the
          formula for the rate of change.
          It then uses a definite integral to create the variable for
          the volume,
          <me>V(t) = 500 + \int_{1}^{t} -40+3z \, dz</me>.

            var("t")

            DV(t) = -40+3*t
            show(DV(t))
            # Define the V using integral, but need dummy variable
            var("z")
            V(t) = 500 + integrate(DV(z), [z, 1, t])
            show(V(t))

          The integration variable <m>z</m> was needed in the integral
          for the same reason that a summation in sequence
          accumulations requires a dummy index variable.
          The formula <c>DV(z)</c> represents the formula
          for the rate of change evaluated at this integration
          variable instead of <m>t</m>, <m>-40+3z</m>.
          This could have been computed in WolframAlpha with the query
          <c>integrate -40+3z with respect to z from 1 to t</c>.

      <li>
        Calculus is developed using ideas similar to those for
        sequences<mdash/>limits, increments, and accumulation<mdash/>
        to limits of functions, derivatives, and integrals.
      </li>
      <li>
        The limit of a function <m>\displaystyle \lim_{x \to c} f(x)</m>
        represents the value <m>L</m> that is the limit of the dependent
        sequence <m>f(x_n)</m>
        for <em>every</em> independent sequence <m>(x_n)</m>
        that satisfies <m>x_n \ne c</m> and <m>x_n \to c</m>.
        One-sided limits add the constraint that the sequence must
        stay below <m>c</m> (<m>x \to c^-</m>)
        or above <m>c</m> (<m>x \to c^+</m>).
      </li>
      <li>
        Numerically, a function limit
        <m>\displaystyle \lim_{x \to c} f(x)</m>
        can be approximated by testing the value of the function for
        values of the independent variable following a sequence
        <m>x \to c</m>.
      </li>
      <li>
        The <term>derivative</term> <m>\displaystyle \frac{dQ}{dx}</m>
        measures the <term>instantaneous rate of change</term>
        of a quantity <m>Q</m> with respect to the independent
        variable <m>x</m>, represented by a limit,
        <me>\frac{dQ}{dx} = \lim_{\Delta x\to 0} \frac{\Delta Q}{\Delta x}.</me>
        Consequently, increments of change in <m>Q</m>, <m>\Delta Q</m>,
        will be approximately proportional to the increment in <m>x</m>,
        <me>\Delta Q \approx \frac{dQ}{dx} \cdot \Delta x,</me>
        for sufficiently small <m>\Delta x</m>.
      </li>
      <li>
        Given a function <m>f'</m> for the rate of change of a quantity <m>Q</m>,
        <m>x \overset{f'}\mapsto \frac{dQ}{dx}</m>,
        and an initial value <m>Q_0</m> when <m>x=x_0</m>,
        the <term>accumulation function</term> will be that function
        with derivative <m>\frac{dQ}{dx} = f'(x)</m>,
        represented by the integral
        <me>Q = Q_0 + \int_{x_0}^{x} f'(z) \, dz</me>.
      </li>
      <li>
        Computational tools, such as WolframAlpha and SageMath, are
        available to perform these calculations, leaving us the
        responsibility of formulating problems and interpreting the results.
