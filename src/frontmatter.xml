The frontmatter contains a variety of items that precede
the actual content.  They tend to get placed in the "right"
place and order, and not necessarily the order they appear here.
They differ from "docinfo" items in that they will be *content*
that a reader will actually see.

The xml:id string is used to form a filename for the webpage.
Setting this one to "index" makes for a good default page
when you host your project on a server.

        <p>In order to keep track of changes during the semester, the following list describes the changes that have taken place in the text since August 2016.</p>
        
        <ul>
            <li>Example 2.4.3 includes finding a derivative using technology. The wording originally used the word <q>integral</q> (copy/paste error).</li>
            <li>Continuity of Functions (Section 5.4) was edited to remove redundant information about interval notation.</li>
            <li>The Derivative (Section 5.3) had another example added that involved using conjugates for square roots (Example 5.3.4).</li>knox 2
            <li>Correction to example of <m>L(b)</m> in Section 5.9, Exponential Derivatives. Used to say <m>2^x</m> in every formula.</li>
            <li>Added Derivatives of Trigonometric Functions as Section 5.10, and renumbering Implicit Differentiation as Section 5.11.</li>
