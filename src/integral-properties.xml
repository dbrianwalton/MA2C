  <title>Properties of Definite Integrals</title>
  <introduction>
    <title>Overview</title>
    <p>
      Motivated by the properties of total accumulated change and of area,
      the definite integral inherits several significant properties.
      These properties are stated as theorems.
      We will be interested in applying the results of the theorems.
      However, to prove these properties is outside the scope of this text.
      We essentially think of these properties as the axioms of definite integrals,
      basic properties which must always be true.
    </p>
  </introduction>
  <subsection>
    <title>Splitting and Linearity Properties</title>
    <p>
      Splitting properties are motivated by considering adjacent intervals,
      say <m>[a,b]</m> and <m>[b,c]</m>,
      and requiring that the definite integral on <m>[a,c]</m>
      is the sum of the integrals over the two pieces,
      <me>\int_{a}^{b} f(x) \, dx + \int_b^c f(x) \, dx = \int_{a}^{c} f(x) \, dx.</me>
      However, this would seem to require that <m>a \lt b \lt c</m>.
      While this is certainly true, the definite integral
      is defined in a way that the order does not matter.
    </p>
    <p>
      Recalling that the definite integral is motivated
      as the mathematical tool to compute the total change in a quantity
      as the accumulated change resulting from its rate of change,
      this result could be interpreted as saying,
      <q>The total change in <m>Q</m> as <m>x</m> goes from <m>a</m> to <m>c</m>
      is equal to the change in <m>Q</m> as <m>x</m> goes first
      from <m>a</m> to <m>b</m> plus the change as <m>x</m>
      then goes from <m>b</m> to <m>c</m>.</q>
    </p>
    <theorem xml:id="thm-definite-integral-splitting">
      <title>Splitting Property of Definite Integrals</title>
      <statement>
      <p>
      Suppose that <m>f</m> is integrable on an interval
      that contains <m>a</m>, <m>b</m> and <m>c</m>.
      Then <me> \int_{a}^{b} f(x) dx + \int_{b}^{c} f(x) dx = \int_{a}^{c} f(x) dx. </me>
      </p>
      </statement>
    </theorem>
    <p>
    Similarly, if <m>x</m> does not change,
    then the dependent quantity <m>Q</m> should also not change,
    regardless of the function defining the rate of change.
    This is the motivation for the next theorem.
    </p>
    <theorem xml:id="thm-integral-empty">
      <title>Integral on an Empty Interval</title>
      <statement>
      <p>
      For any function <m>f</m>, <me> \int_{a}^{a} f(x) \, dx = 0. </me>
      </p>
      </statement>
    </theorem>
    <p>
      Combining these theorems, we obtain a reversal property of definite integrals.
      If we switch the order of the limits of integration,
      then the value of the definite integral must change sign.
    </p>
    <theorem xml:id="thm-definite-integral-reverse">
      <title>Integral in Reverse</title>
      <statement>
        <p>
          For any function <m>f</m>,
          <me> \int_{b}^{a} f(x) \, dx = - \int_{a}^{b} f(x) \, dx. </me>
        </p>
      </statement>
      <proof>
        <p>
          Because an integral starting and ending at <m>a</m> must equal zero,
          if we go from <m>a</m> to <m>b</m> and then back,
          there must be no overall change:
          <me> \int_{a}^{b} f(x) \, dx + \int_{b}^{a} f(x) \, dx = \int_{a}^{a} f(x) \, dx = 0. </me>
          This means the two integrals are additive inverses to each other.
        </p>
      </proof>
    </theorem>
    <p>
      It is important to remember that the interpretation of a definite integral
      as signed area only applied when the limits of integration go from left to right.
      When the limits of integration go from right to left,
      we compute the signed area but need to reverse the sign because of the direction of integration.
    </p>
    <example>
      <statement>
        <p>
        Suppose that we know <m>\displaystyle \int_{0}^{4} f(x)\,dx = 6</m>
        and <m>\displaystyle \int_{3}^{4} f(x) \, dx = 10</m>.
        Find <m>\displaystyle \int_{0}^{3} f(x) \, dx</m>.
        </p>
      </statement>
      <solution>
        <p>
        We use the splitting property of definite integrals.
        The interval <m>[0,4]</m> can be split into <m>[0,3]</m> and <m>[3,4]</m>
        so that <me> \int_{0}^{4} f(x)\, dx = \int_0^3 f(x)\,dx + \int_3^4 f(x)\,dx. </me>
        We know two of the integrals and can solve for the third:
        <me> 6 = \int_0^3 f(x)\,dx + 10 \qquad \Leftrightarrow \qquad \int_0^3 f(x)\,dx = -4. </me>
        </p>
        <p>
        An alternate approach for finding the integral is
        to start with the integral that is wanted, using the interval <m>[0,3]</m>,
        so that we start at <m>0</m> and end at <m>3</m>.
        We will use the splitting property using out-of-order points
        and go from <m>0</m> to <m>4</m> and then from <m>4</m> to <m>3</m>:
        <me> \int_{0}^{3} f(x)\, dx = \int_0^4 f(x)\,dx + \int_4^3 f(x)\,dx. </me>
        The second integral is in a reversed order.
        If we switch the order to go left-to-right,
        then the integral is subtracted instead of added:
        <me> \int_{0}^{3} f(x)\, dx = \int_0^4 f(x)\,dx - \int_3^4 f(x)\,dx = 6 - 10 = -4. </me>
        </p>
      </solution>

        Because the graph consists of straight lines, we can use geometry to calculate areas and use signed area to determine values of definite integrals. Shading the region between the graph <m>y=f(x)</m> and the axis <m>y=0</m> and between <m>x=-3</m> and <m>x=0</m>, we get the figure shown below.

        The region between <m>x=-3</m> and <m>x=-1</m> is a trapezoid
        that has area <m>\frac{1}{2}(1+2)(3) = \frac{9}{2}</m>.
        The region between <m>x=-1</m> and <m>x=0</m> is a triangle
        with area <m>\frac{1}{2}(1)(3) = \frac{3}{2}</m>.
        Signed area corresponds to an integral from left-to-right so that
        <me> \int_{-3}^{0} f(x)\,dx = -\frac{9}{2} + \frac{3}{2} = -\frac{6}{2} = -3. </me>
        The integral of interest uses the opposite order,
        and so has the opposite sign:
        <me> \int_{0}^{-3} f(x)\, dx = -\int_{-3}^0 f(x)\,dx = -(-3) = 3. </me>

      </solution>

    <p>
    Because a definite integral is defined in terms of summation
    and summation has linearity properties,
    the definite integral inherits a constant multiple rule and a sum rule.

      Then <me> \int_{a}^{b} [\alpha f(x)] dx = \alpha \int_{a}^{b} f(x)\,dx. </me>
