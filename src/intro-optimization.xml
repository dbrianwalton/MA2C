  <title>Extreme Values and Optimization</title>
  <introduction>
    <p>
      We have learned earlier that when a function <m>f(x)</m> can be written as an accumulation function,
      we can describe the behavior of the function in terms of its rate of accumulation <m>f'(x)</m>.
      We use sign analysis of <m>f'(x)</m> to find the intervals of monotonicity of <m>f(x)</m>.
      And if <m>f'(x)</m> can also be written as an accumulation function with rate <m>f''(x)</m>,
      the sign analysis of <m>f''(x)</m> determines the intervals of concavity of <m>f(x)</m>.
    </p>
    <p>
      In this section, we apply this information to describe the extreme values of a function.
      By identifying points where <m>f'(x)</m> changes sign, we can find local maximum and minimum values.
      Applications involving the identification of extreme values are often called optimization problems.
      The task in optimization is to identify the value of an independent variable in the system
      that will maximize or minimize some objective.
      Aside from the calculus in finding the extreme values,
      creating an appropriate function that will serve as the objective is often the greatest challenge.
    </p>

    <title>Local Extreme Values</title>
    <p>
      When the derivative <m>f'(x)</m> changes sign at a point where <m>f(x)</m> is continuous,
      the function has a local or relative extreme value.
      We begin by focusing on what we mean by a local extreme value.
      A local extreme is a point where the function reaches either its highest or lowest point
      <em>on an interval around that point</em>.
      The function might exceed the value on some other interval,
      but the value needs to be the extreme in a neighborhood of the point.
    </p>
    <definition>
      <title>Local (Relative) Extreme Values</title>
      <statement>
        <p>
          A function <m>f(x)</m> has a <term>local maximum</term> at a point <m>x=c</m> in the domain
          if there is an interval <m>(a,b)</m> with <m>c \in (a,b)</m>
          so that <m>f(x) \le f(c)</m> for all <m>x \in (a,b)</m>.
        </p>
        <p>
          A function <m>f(x)</m> has a <term>local minimum</term> at a point <m>x=c</m> in the domain
          if there is an interval <m>(a,b)</m> with <m>c \in (a,b)</m>
          so that <m>f(c) \le f(x)</m> for all <m>x \in (a,b)</m>.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </definition>
    <p>
      The reason that the definition describes these extreme values as local extremes
      is that the function might go higher or lower at some point outside of the interval.
      A local or relative extreme value is only at the highest or lowest points relative to its immediate neighbors.
      The following graph illustrates a function with multiple local extreme values.

          a short interval of decreasing to a local minimum labeled D,
          another short interval of increasing to a local maximum labeled E,
          then decreases to a local minimum labeled F,
          after which the function increases without bound to plus infinity.

    <p>
      The function shows local maxima at points labeled <m>A</m>, <m>C</m>, and <m>E</m>
      and local minima at points labeled <m>B</m>, <m>D</m>, and <m>F</m>.
      Of the three maxima, the value at <m>A</m> is the greatest.
      Because the graph continues to increase after <m>F</m>, however,
      the function reaches values higher than all of the local maxima.
      Similarly, the minimum at <m>F</m> is the lowest of the three lolal minima
      but the function reach values even lower at points to the left of <m>A</m>.
    </p>
    <p>
      One observation we should make is that the local extreme values occurred
      where the function transitioned between an interval of increasing to an interval of decreasing.
      Such points are called turning points.
      Sign analysis using the first derivative can often identify these turning points,
      so we use sign analysis to find local extreme values.
      The applicable theorem is called the first derivative test for extreme values.
    </p>
    <theorem>
      <title>First Derivative Test</title>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Suppose that <m>f'(x)</m> exists on an interval <m>(a,b)</m>,
          possibly except at <m>x=c</m> with <m>a \lt c \lt b</m>
          and that <m>f(x)</m> is continuous at <m>x=c</m>.

              If <m>f'(x) \lt 0</m> for <m>x \in (a,c)</m> and <m>f'(x) \gt 0</m> for <m>x \in (c,b)</m>,
              then <m>f(x)</m> is decreasing on <m>(a,c]</m> and increasing on <m>[c,b)</m>
              so that <m>f</m> has a <term>local minimum</term> at <m>x=c</m>.
            </li>
            <li>
              If <m>f'(x) \gt 0</m> for <m>x \in (a,c)</m> and <m>f'(x) \lt 0</m> for <m>x \in (c,b)</m>,
              then <m>f(x)</m> is increasing on <m>(a,c]</m> and decreasing on <m>[c,b)</m>
              so that <m>f</m> has a <term>local maximum</term> at <m>x=c</m>.
            </li>
            <li>
              If <m>f'(x)</m> does not change sign,
              then <m>f</m> does <em>not</em> have a local extreme value at <m>x=c</m>.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </p>
      </statement>
    </theorem>
    <example>
      <statement>
        <p>
          The function <me>\displaystyle f(x) = \frac{x}{x^2+3}</me>
          has a derivative <me>f'(x) = \frac{3-x^2}{(x^2+3)^2}.</me>
          Describe the local extreme values of <m>f(x)</m>.
        </p>
      </statement>
      <solution>
        <p>
          The denominator of <m>f'(x)</m> is never zero because <m>x^2+3 \ge 3</m> will never equal zero.
          So the sign can only change where <m>3-x^2=0</m> which occurs at two values, <m>x=\pm\sqrt{3}</m>.
          There are three intervals of interest.
          We can find the signs of <m>f'(x)</m> using the values <m>x=-2</m>, <m>x=0</m> and <m>x=2</m>.
          The signs are summarized in the number line summary below.

    <title>Global Extreme Values</title>
    <p>
      In <xref ref="figure-illustrate-local-extremes" />, we saw that when a function has local extreme values,
      there could still be other points that are not local extremes that exceed the extremes.
      This leads to the idea of <term>global extreme values</term>.
    </p>
    <definition xml:id="definition-global-extreme-values">
      <statement>
        <p>
          Suppose the function <m>f</m> has domain <m>D</m>.
          <ul>
            <li>
              <m>f</m> has a <term>global maximum</term> at <m>c \in D</m>
              if <m>f(c) \ge f(x)</m> for all <m>x \in D</m>.
            </li>

    <p>
      To identify global extremes of a function,
      we first need to find all of the local extreme values.
      Then we use additional information to test whether the function manages to reach beyond those values.
      This generally involves computing limits of the function on intervals not already accounted for by the local extremes.
    </p>
    <example>
      <statement>

          Find the global extreme values of <m>f(x) = 4x^2 - x^3</m> restricted to each of the following domains.

      </statement>
      <solution>
        <p>
          Regardless of which domain we use, we will need to find the local extreme values.
          Local extreme values are identified from sign analysis of <m>f'(x)</m>.
          We find <me>f'(x)=4(2x) - (3x^2) = 8x - 3x^2</me>.
          Sign analysis begins by finding the roots, where <m>f'(x)=0</m>.
          <md>
            <mrow> 8x-3x^2 = 0</mrow>
            <mrow> x(8-3x) = 0</mrow>
            <mrow> x=0, \quad 8-3x=0</mrow>
            <mrow> x=0, \quad x=\frac{8}{3}</mrow>
          </md>
          Because <m>f'(x)</m> is continuous, the roots determine the test intervals:
          <m>(-\infty,0)</m>, <m>(0,\frac{8}{3})</m>, and <m>(\frac{8}{3},\infty)</m>.
          Testing one value of <m>x</m> from each interval in <m>f'(x) = x(8-3x)</m>,
          we find the signs summarized on the following number line.

      <title>Optimization</title>

      <p>Optimization is the application of finding extreme values to either maximize or minimize some quantity of interest. In general, we will have a system where there is some variable that we have freedom to vary and some quantity that is a function of that variable that we want to be at a maximum or minimum value. The variable that we vary is the independent variable. The quantity that we optimize is the dependent variable and is often called the <term>objective function</term>.</p>

      <p>Frequently, the more challenging aspect of an optimization problem is identifying the appropriate function. Once the function is identified, the task is reduced to identifying local extreme values and determining whether one of those might also be the extreme value of interest. If there are multiple independent varaibles, we generally find a constraint that allows us to treat one as a dependent variable so that we ultimately only have a single independent variable.</p>

      <p>Several simple examples come from geometry where we need to construct a shape that has some feature (like a given perimeter, area or volume) and we wish to make some other feature as large as possible. We use these examples not because they are practical but because they illustrate the principles of optimization effectively.</p>

      <example>
          <statement>
              <p>Suppose we want to cut out a rectangle that has an area of <m>500 \; cm^2</m> but that horizontal and vertical cuts have different costs. If a horizontal cut costs twice as much as a vertical cut per centimeter, how should we cut the rectangle to minimize our cost?</p>
          </statement>
          <solution>
              <p>Start by identifying the variables. <ul>
                  <li><m>h</m> is the horizontal width of the rectangle</li>
                  <li><m>v</m> is the vertical length of the rectangle</li>
                  <li><m>C</m> is the cost of making the rectangle</li>
              </ul> Once we have identified our variables, we need to find a formula for the cost because that is what we want to minimize. Let <m>p</m> be the unit cost for a vertical cut of 1 cm so that <m>2p</m> is the cost of a horizontal cut of 1 cm. The rectangle involves two horizontal cuts and two vertical cuts. So the total cost is given by <me>C = 2h \cdot 2p + 2v \cdot p = (4h+2v) p.</me> The value of <m>p</m> is just the unit cost, so we really want to minimize <m>C = 4h+2v</m> (measured in <m>p</m> units).</p>
              <p>Our objective function involves two independent variables. This means there must be an additional constraint. Reviewing the problem, we recall that the total area needs to be <m>500 \; cm^2</m>. The area is computed by <m>A=h \cdot v = 500</m> so that we can treat <m>v</m> as another dependent variable, <me>v = \frac{500}{h}.</me> Substituting this formula into our objective function, we can rewrite it involving only a single independent variable <m>h</m>: <me>C = 4h + 2 \cdot \frac{500}{h} = 4h + \frac{1000}{h}.</me></p>
              <p>Next, we find the derivative: <me>C'(h) = 4 - \frac{1000}{h^2}.</me> We want to see where the derivative is positive and negative, so we find a common denominator and then factor: <me>C'(h) = \frac{4h^2-1000}{h^2} = \frac{4(h^2-250)}{h^2}.</me> As a mathematical function, there is a vertical asymptote at <m>h=0</m> and intercepts at <m>h= \pm \sqrt{250}</m>. Geometrically, only <m>h \gt 0</m> makes physical sense, so we do sign analysis on <m>(0,\sqrt{250})</m> and <m>(\sqrt{250},\infty)</m>.</p>

              <p>We finish by interpreting our mathematics. The question was how to cut the rectangle. Our analysis gave us a value for <m>h=\sqrt{250} \approx 15.81 \; cm</m>. We also need <m>v</m>, which was another dependent variable: <me>v=\frac{500}{h} = \frac{500}{\sqrt{250}} = 2 \sqrt{250} \approx 31.62 \; cm.</me> The minimal cost rectangle would have a horizontal cut of 15.81 cm and a vertical cut of 31.62 cm.</p>

      <p>A biological example follows. A fundamental hypothesis of biology is that evolution drives organisms to maximize their fitness, which corresponds to the number of surviving offspring. There is often a trade-off between the number of offspring and the probability that the offspring survive. Let <m>f</m> (fecundity) represent the number of offspring an organism produces and let <m>s</m> (survival) represent the probability that an offspring will survive. The then fitness is given by <m>F=f \cdot s</m>, the average number of offspring that survive.</p>

      <example>
          <statement>
              <p>Suppose that the survival probability is related to fecundity so that it decreases exponentially according to the equation <me>s = e^{-0.012f}.</me> How many offspring should the organism have to maximize fitness?</p>
          </statement>
          <solution>
              <p>First, identify the variables. The objective function is the fitness <m>F</m>. This depends on both <m>f</m> (fecundity) and <m>s</m> (survival probability) through <m>F = f \cdot s</m>. The given relation between <m>f</m> and <m>s</m> expresses <m>s</m> as a dependent variable so that we treat <m>f</m> as the independent variable. Then we can write <me>F = f \cdot e^{-0.012f}.</me></p>
              <p>Second, we compute a derivative to determine the extreme values. We find <me>F'(f) = e^{-0.012f} - 0.012f e^{-0.012f}.</me> Our strategy is always to factor the formula in order to find intercepts. In this case, the common factor is the exponential term so that <me>F'(f) = e^{-0.012f}\cdot(1-0.012f).</me> The exponential term is always positive, so the only intercept is when <m>1-0.012f = 0</m> which has a solution <m>f = \frac{1}{0.012} = \frac{250}{3}</m>. Using this, our sign analysis for <m>F'(f)</m> consists of two intervals.</p>

              <p>The sign analysis implies that <m>F</m> is increasing on <m>(-\infty,\frac{250}{3})</m> and decreasing on <m>(\frac{250}{3},\infty)</m>. The first derivative test then implies that <m>F</m> has a maximum value when <m>f=\frac{250}{3}\approx 83.33</m> on the interval <m>(-\infty,\infty)</m>. We only needed a maximum on <m>[0,\infty)</m> (physically relevant), so this is result is appropriate. The organism will optimize fitness if the average number of offspring is 83.33 individuals.</p>
