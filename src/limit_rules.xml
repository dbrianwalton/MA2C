    <title>Limit Rules</title>

    <introduction>
    <p>
    So far, we have been taking advantage of the fact that 
    simple algebraic formulas are continuous.
    When taking limits so far, all we have done is 
    use the value of the formula at the point in question.
    However, this is not always the case.
    </p>
    
    <p>
    In <xref ref="calculus-overview"/>, we introduced an alternative
    <xref ref="definition-limit-by-sequences">definition of function limits</xref>.
    That definition stated that the value of <m>\displaystyle \lim_{x \to a} f(x)</m>
    equals that value <m>L</m> to which a dependent sequence <m>f(x_n)</m> would converge
    <em>for every</em> independent sequence <m>x=(x_n)</m> with <m>x_n \ne a</m> and <m>x_n \to a</m>.
    To understand the limits of functions better,
    we first need to recognize the rules of limits of sequences .
    Limit rules are a powerful collection of theorems 
    that allow us to find limits using elementary rules.
    </p>
    
    <p>
    Mathematics uses deductive reasoning (built on axioms and logical implications) 
    to establish rules for what must be true based on our fundamental assumptions of how things work. 
    These proven consequences are called theorems. 
    Every theorem has two partsâ€”a hypothesis and a conclusion.
    A hypothesis is a  collection of conditions that must be checked 
    to see if the theorem's conclusion can be applied. 
    A conclusion is a statement that is guaranteed to be true 
    so long as the hypothesis has been satisfied.
    </p>
    
    <p>
    When we wish to apply a theorem, it is our duty to first check 
    that all of the conditions in the hypothesis have been satisfied. 
    Once this is complete, then you interpret the conclusion for the context of your problem 
    and cite the relevant theorem as the justification.
    </p>
    </introduction>
    
    <subsection>

    <title>Limit Rules for Combining Sequences</title>
    
    <p>
    We start by formalizing some rules about how limits of sequence
    relate to arithmetic of sequences.
    We begin each theorem with one or more sequence that is given
    with a particular limit.
    We then define a new sequence using arithmetic involving those sequences.
    The conclusion of each theorem describes the limit of the new sequence.
    </p>
    
    <p>
    For a converging sequence <m>x=(x_n)</m> with <m>x_n \to L</m>, 
    we can think of the sequence values as <em>approximating</em> <m>L</m>.
    The absolute error of approximation <m>|x_n - L|</m> must vanish as <m>n \to \infty</m>.
    In other words, for any margin of error <m>\epsilon \gt 0</m>,
    there must be some index <m>N</m> so that <m>|x_n - L| \lt \epsilon</m> once <m>n \gt N</m>.
    The proofs of these theorems rely on showing how the error of approximation
    for the arithmetic combination of the sequences
    can be related to the errors of approximations of the given sequences to their limits
    in a way to show that the approximation will eventually vanish.
    </p>
    
    <p>
    The first three rules involve operations on only a single sequence.

    <theorem xml:id="SLC-Constant-Sum">
      <title>Sequence Limit of a Constant Sum (SL:CS)</title>
      <statement>
        <p>
        Given a sequence <m>u=(u_n)</m> with <m>u_n \to L</m> and any constant <m>k</m>,
        the transformed sequence <m>w_n = u_n + k</m> has limit
        <me> \lim_{n \to \infty} u_n+k = L+k.</me>
        </p>
      </statement>
      <proof>
        <p>
        The error of approximation for <m>w_n</m> from its proposed limit <m>L+k</m> 
        can be rewritten
        <me>|w_n - (L+k)| = |u_n + k - L - k| = |u_n - L|</me>.
        This is the same as the error of approximation for <m>u_n</m> from its limit <m>L</m>.
        As soon as <m>|u_n - L| \lt \epsilon</m>, we also have <m>|w_n - (L+k)| \lt \epsilon</m>.
        Because <m>|u_n - L| \to 0</m>, this proves
        <me> \lim_{n \to \infty} u_n+k = L+k.</me>
        </p>
      </proof>
    </theorem>
    
    <theorem xml:id="SLC-Constant-Multiple">
      <title>Sequence Limit of a Constant Sum (SL:CM)</title>
      <statement>
        <p>
        Given a sequence <m>u=(u_n)</m> with <m>u_n \to L</m> and any constant <m>k</m>,
        the transformed sequence <m>w_n = k \cdot u_n</m> has limit
        <me> \lim_{n \to \infty} k \, u_n = k \, L.</me>
        </p>
      </statement>
      <proof>
        <p>
        The error of approximation for <m>w_n</m> from its proposed limit <m>kL</m> 
        can be rewritten
        <me>|w_n - kL| = |ku_n - kL| = |k(u_n - L)| = |k|\cdot |u_n - L|</me>.
        If <m>k=0</m>, then <m>w_n = 0</m> for all <m>n</m> and <m>w_n \to 0</m> must be true.
        If <m>k \ne 0</m>, then the error of approximation for <m>w</m> from its proposed limit
        is exactly <m>|k|</m> times the error of approximation for <m>u</m> from its given limit.
        As soon as <m>|u_n - L| \lt \frac{1}{|k|} \epsilon</m>, we must have <m>|w_n - kL| \lt \epsilon</m>.
        Because <m>|u_n - L| \to 0</m>, this proves
        <me> \lim_{n \to \infty} k \, u_n = k \, L.</me>
        </p>
      </proof>
    </theorem>
    
    <theorem xml:id="SLC-MultInverse">
      <title>Sequence Limit of a Reciprocal (SL:MInv)</title>
      <statement>
        <p>
        Given a sequence <m>u=(u_n)</m> with <m>u_n \to L \ne 0</m>,
        the transformed sequence of multiplicative inverses <m>w_n = \frac{1}{u_n}</m> has limit
        <me> \lim_{n \to \infty} \frac{1}{u_n} = \frac{1}{L}.</me>
        </p>
      </statement>
      <proof>
        <p>
        Division is not defined when the denominator equals zero.
        Because <m>u_n \to L</m> and <m>L \ne 0</m>, we know that <m>|u_n - L| \lt \frac{1}{2}|L|</m> eventually.
        When <m>L \gt 0</m>, this means that <m>\frac{1}{2}L \lt u_n \lt \frac{3}{2} L</m>.
        If <m>L \lt 0</m>, then <m>\frac{3}{2}L \lt u_n \lt \frac{1}{2}L</m>.
        Either way, <m>u_n</m> is kept away from 0 and <m>w_n = \frac{1}{u_n}</m> is guaranteed to be defined.
        (Before this point, we might have had <m>u_n=0</m> so that <m>w_n</m> is not defined.
        </p>
        <p>
        The error of approximation for <m>w_n</m> from its proposed limit <m>\frac{1}{L}</m> 
        can be rewritten using a common denominator
        <me>|w_n - \frac{1}{L}| = |\frac{1}{u_n} - \frac{1}{L}| = |\frac{L-u_n}{u_n L}| = |u_n - L| \cdot \frac{1}{|u_n||L|}</me>.
        Because <m>|u_n| \gt \frac{1}{2}|L|</m>, we know that <m>\displaystyle \frac{1}{|u_n|} \lt \frac{2}{|L|}</m>.
        Thus,
        <me>|w_n - \frac{1}{L}| \lt |u_n - L| \cdot \frac{2}{|L|^2}</me>.
        The error of approximation for <m>w_n</m> is always smaller than 
        <m>\frac{2}{|L|^2}</m> times the error of approximation for <m>u_n</m> from its limit.
        Because <m>|u_n - L| \to 0</m>, this proves
        <me> \lim_{n \to \infty} \frac{1}{u_n} = \frac{1}{L}.</me>
        </p>
      </proof>
    </theorem>

    <p>
      The second group of limit rules of combination allow us to take two limits that we know and combine them with arithmetic.

              the sequence defined by the sum <m>w_n = u_n + v_n</m> has limit

    <title>Elementary Limit Rules</title>
    
    <p>
      The first collection of limit rules are some basic limits.
      We can think of them as our building blocks for more complicated limits.
      In reality, each of these limit rules are really statements about continuity of these very elementary functions.

        <title>Limit of a Constant (LE:Const)</title>

            <p>Conclusion: <m>\displaystyle \lim_{x \to a} k = k</m>.</p>

            <p>Conclusion: <m>\displaystyle \lim_{x \to a} x = a</m>.</p>
        </statement>
    </theorem>
    
    <p>
      Note: The name of the previous theorem is based on the function <m>f(x)=x</m> being called the identity function because the output is exactly the input.

    <subsection>
    <title>Limit Rules of Combination</title>
    
    <p>
      The second collection of limit rules tell us how we can take limits that we already know (starting with building blocks)
      and use them to compute more complicated limits.
      The first three rules take a single limit that is known to be valid and use arithmetic with a constant to find a new limit.
    </p>
    
    <theorem xml:id='LC-Constant-Sum'>
        <title>Limit of a Constant Sum (LC:CS)</title>
        <statement>

            <p>Hypothesis: <m>\displaystyle \lim_{x \to a} f(x)=L</m> and <m>L \ne 0</m>.</p>
            <p>Conclusion: <m>\displaystyle \lim_{x \to a} \frac{1}{f(x)} = \frac{1}{L}</m>.</p>
        </statement>
    </theorem>

    <p>
      The next limit rules of combination allow us to take two limits that we know and combine them with arithmetic.
      In each of the cases, note that both limits in the hypothesis have <m>x \to a</m> (i.e., <m>x</m> approaches the same value in both limits).

    <theorem xml:id='LC-Sum'>
      <title>Limit of a Sum (LC:Sum)</title>
      <statement>

    <theorem xml:id='LC-Quotient'>
      <title>Limit of a Quotient (LC:Quot)</title>
      <statement>
        <p>Hypothesis: <m>\displaystyle \lim_{x \to a} f(x)=L</m> and <m>\displaystyle \lim_{x \to a} g(x)=M</m> and <m>M \ne 0</m>.</p>

      </statement>
    </theorem>
    
    <p>
      In addition to the arithmetic of functions, composition of functions plays an important role in algebra and calculus.
      So we need a limit rule associated with composition.
      Recall that for composition, the output of one function becomes the input to another function.
    </p>
    
    <theorem xml:id='LC-Continuous-Composition'>
      <title>Limit of a Continuous Composition (LC:Comp)</title>
      <statement>
        <p>Hypothesis: <m>\displaystyle \lim_{x \to a} f(x)=L</m> and <m>g</m> is continuous at <m>L</m>, or in other words, <m>\displaystyle \lim_{u \to L} g(u) = g(L)</m>.</p>
        <p>Conclusion: <m>\displaystyle \lim_{x \to a} g \circ f(x) = \lim_{x \to a} g(f(x)) = g(L)</m>.</p>
      </statement>
    </theorem>
    
    <p>If <m>f</m> is continuous at <m>a</m> so that <m>\displaystyle \lim_{x \to a} f(x) = f(a)</m> then we have <m>\displaystyle \lim_{x \to a} g \circ f(x) = g \circ f(a)</m>. In other words, the composition of continuous functions is a continuous function.</p>

    <p>Each of these limit rules is proved using a more precise definition of what a limit means. For now, we will consider these rules as a starting point for evaluating limits.</p>
    </subsection>

    <subsection>
    <title>Justifying Limit Calculations</title>
    
    <p>There are two ways in which limit rules are applied. One way is to provide formal justification of limit calculations, or in other words, to write a proof of limit statements. The other way limit rules are used is to break a computation down into recognizable and manageable parts. This section focuses on the process of formal justification.</p>
    
    <p>A mathematical proof is essentially a sequence of statements, each of which is demonstrably true based only on previously stated knowledge and logical arguments. This means that when writing a proof or any careful justification, we must be careful that when we write something down we have previously established all of the necessary conditions at a previous step. In order to avoid circular reasoning, we should avoid referring to something as true before we actually show it is true.</p>
    
    <p>For justification of limit statements, this means that we start from the small building blocks that create our formula and put them together one step at a time until we can justify the limit statement we are trying to prove.</p>
    
    <example>
    <statement>
        <p>Compute and justify <m>\displaystyle \lim_{x \to 2} 3x^2(2x-5)</m>.</p>
    </statement>
    <solution>
        <p>Start by planning ahead. The formula <m>3x^2(2x-5)</m> is a product of <m>3x^2</m> and <m>2x-5</m>. This second factor <m>2x-5</m> is a linear function so there is a limit rule for that piece. But <m>3x^2</m> is not linear, so we recognize it as a product of <m>3</m> (a constant) and <m>x^2</m>. Finally, we see that <m>x^2=x \cdot x</m> is the product of the identity with itself. We will start with the elementary formulas and build them back up to the full function.</p>

        <p>It is important to note that limit rules of combination only combine two formulas at a time. In this calculation, we will need the limit of <m>x^3</m>. Writing this as <m>x^3=x\cdot x\cdot x</m> is not going to be as useful as writing <m>x^3=x \cdot x^2</m> because there are no rules to combine three limits at once. In addition, subtraction is always problematic, so it is best to rewrite subtraction as a sum, <me>x^3+4x^2-3x+1 = x^3 + 4x^2 + -3x+1. </me></p>
