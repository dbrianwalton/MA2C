  <title>Limits of Sequences</title>

  <subsection>
    <title>Overview</title>
    
    <p>
    The limit of a sequence describes its end behavior.
    A sequence can have similar end behavior as any other function.
    (Recall <xref ref="functions-behavior-end-limits"/>.)
    Some sequences seemed to level off to a single value, approaching a horizontal asymptote.
    Other sequences grow without bound, either rising to <m>+\infty</m> or falling to <m>-\infty</m>.
    Additionally, sequences might approach a repeating pattern or have no pattern at all.
    In this section, we focus on describing the limiting behavior of sequences that level off 
    to a single limiting value or grow without bound.
    </p>
    
    <p>
    The objectives for this section are as follows.
    We will focus on what it means for a sequence to have a limit. 
    Then we will learn how to determine the limiting values for sequences defined explicitly using limit arithmetic. 
    Additionally, we will also learn about limits of sequences defined recursively 
    in terms of fixed points of the projection function .
    </p>

    <title>What Is A Limit?</title>
    
    <p>
    We want to say that a sequence has a <term>limit</term> 
    if the plot of the sequence values levels off to a single value. 
    The limit will be that value to which the sequence is <term>converging</term>. 
    The numerical interpretation of this perspective is that 
    if you looked at a table of values for the sequence, 
    the values of the sequence needs to have its values get closer and closer to some limiting value. 
    In a decimal representation, more and more of the digits need to stop changing 
    the further you go down in the sequence.
    </p>
    
    <p>
    We start with a few examples to build our intuition.
    </p>
    
    <example>
      <p>
      The table below represent the values for a sequence defined explicitly as 
      <m>\displaystyle x_n = \frac{3+2^n}{1+3 \cdot 2^n}</m>, 
      shown with up to 12 decimal places. 
      A plot of the sequence is also shown.

      <p>
      The plot for the sequence shows that the sequence appears to be leveling off. 
      Looking at the table, we see that more and more of the digits are converging to a 3. 
      If this pattern is real and continues, the limiting value would be the repeating decimal <m>0.3333\ldots</m> 
      which is the rational number <m>\frac{1}{3}</m>. 
      We would say that this sequence has a limit of <m>\frac{1}{3}</m>.
      We write either <m>x_n \to \frac{1}{3}</m> or <me>\lim_{n \to \infty} x_n = \frac{1}{3}</me>.
      </p>
    </example>
    
    <example>
      <p>
      Another sequence, defined explicitly by the formula 
      <me>u_n = 1+\frac{1}{2}\cdot(-1+\frac{1}{2^n})^n,</me> 
      is similarly illustrated by a table and figure.

      <p>
      Notice that for this sequence, the graph appears to level off to two different values. 
      However, this is because the sequence is actually approaching two alternating values. 
      This is an example of approaching a repeating pattern rather than a value,
      most easily seen in the table.
      As we look further down the table,
      the odd index values correspond to a sequence value that is getting closer to 0.5 
      while the even index values correspond to a sequence value that is getting closer to 1.5. 
      This sequence does not have a limit because the sequence is not approaching a single value.
      We say <m>\displaystyle \lim_{n \to \infty} x_n</m> does not exist.
      </p>
    </example>
    
    <example>
      <p>
      Another third sequence, defined by the nonlinear recursive formula 
      <me>z_{n+1} = 2.7 z_n - 0.7 z_n^2</me> 
      with initial value <m>z_0 = 1</m> does not have a convenient explicit formula. 
      However, using a computer to generate approximate values and then graph the sequence, 
      we can explore whether this sequence appears to have a limit.

      Graphically, you should see that the plot shows the sequence values are leveling off to a single value. 
      However, the graph also shows that the values are alternately above and below that limit. 
      We look in the table to determine the limiting value, 
      but it is not obvious from the table what the limiting value should be. 
      Because the values are alternately above and then below whatever the limit should be, 
      we can conclude that the limit must be between the last two values listed. 
      The limit is approximately 2.428 but we do not know the next decimal place 
      without computing more values in the sequence. 
      With additional computation (not shown), 
      we find <m>z_{39} = 2.42857109636261</m> and <m>z_{40} = 2.42857166111753</m> 
      so that our approximation for the limit (a value between <m>z_{39}</m> and <m>z_{40}</m>)
      can be estimated as close to 2.428571.
      To find a better approximation would require more computation.

    With these examples, we can introduce the mathematical definition for the limit of a sequence.
    The idea of a limit <m>x_n \to L</m> is that the value of the sequence <m>x_n</m> 
    approximates the value of <m>L</m> closer and closer as <m>n</m> increases.
    This is made precise by showing that the error of approximation, <m>|x_n - L|</m>,
    will eventually become smaller than any desired accuracy of approximation.

      It appears that the sequence is leveling out to a value near 0.5.
      However, at index <m>n=100</m>, the value is at approximately 
      <m>x_{100} \approx 0.49751244</m> (8 decimal places).
      If the limit really is <m>x_n \to 0.5</m>, then the error of approximation for <m>n=100</m> is
      <me>|x_{100}-0.5| \approx 0.00248756</me>.
      We need to ensure that the error continues to go down.
      At index <m>n=1000</m> (by modifying the script and running again), we have 
      <m>x_{1000} \approx 0.49975012</m> with an error of approximation
      <me>|x_{1000}-0.5| \approx 0.00024988</me>.
      </p>
      <p>
      The explicit formula for the sequence uses the function <m>\displaystyle f(n)=\frac{n}{2n+1}</m> for integer values of <m>n</m>.
      We can think of the continuous function <m>n \overset{f}\mapsto x</m> defined for arbitrary values of <m>n</m>
      The inverse <m>f^{-1}: x \mapsto n</m> can inform us of when the sequence reaches different values.
      <md>
        <mrow>x = \frac{n}{2n+1}</mrow>
        <mrow>(2n+1)x = n </mrow>
        <mrow>2n x + x = n</mrow>
        <mrow>2n x - n = -x</mrow>
        <mrow>(2x-1) n = -x</mrow>
        <mrow>n = \frac{-x}{2x-1} = \frac{x}{1-2x}</mrow>
      </md>
      This function, <m>\displaystyle f^{-1}(x)=\frac{x}{1-2x}</m>, gives the relation <m>x \mapsto n</m>.
      </p>
      <p>
      From our graph, we have seen that <m>(n,x_n)</m> is increasing and concave down.
      Given <em>any</em> desired error of approximation <m>\epsilon \gt 0</m>, 
      we can use our inverse function to see exactly when the sequence rises above <m>x_n \gt \frac{1}{2}-\epsilon</m>.
      For example, with <m>\epsilon = 0.001</m>, we want to find when <m>x_n \gt 0.5-0.001=0.499</m>.
      We find <me>f^{-1}(0.499) = \frac{0.499}{1-2(0.499)} =249.5</me>.
      The sequence, which requires integer index values, will therefore 
      be above <m>x_n \gt 0.499</m> for <m>n \ge 250</m>.
      We can verify this numerically by running the script to show a table for index values surrounding <m>n=250</m>.

    Using a table of values to find a limit only allows us to estimate its value. 
    In addition, it is not clear from a table whether the pattern that this estimation is based on 
    will continue or change. 
    So it would be helpful to have some rules for finding limits 
    based on the formula rather than numerical patterns.

    In order to compute limits of sequences, 
    we first need to understand that some sequences grow without bound, 
    which is written <m>x_n \to \infty</m> when the sequence grows in a positive direction 
    or <m>x_n \to -\infty</m> when the sequence grows in a negative direction. 
    Arithmetic sequences with increments <m>c \ne 0</m> 
    (recall <xref ref="thm-arithmetic-sequence-recursion"/>) 
    must either steadily increase (<m>c \gt 0</m>) or steadily decrease (<m>c \lt 0</m>). 
    The special case that <m>c=0</m> is somewhat boring, 
    as this corresponds to a constant sequence so that the limit is just the constant value.

    Geometric sequences are a little more complicated, depending on the ratio <m>\rho</m> 
    (recall <xref ref="thm-geometric-sequence-recursion"/>) and the initial value. 
    Repeated multiplication by a number whose magnitude is larger than 1 
    makes the resulting magnitude increase without bound. 
    Repeated multiplication by a number whose magnitude is smaller than 1 
    makes the resulting magnitude converge to 0. 
    If the ratio is negative, then the sign of the sequence values will alternate between positive and negative.

    Once we know how to identify when sequences have unbounded terms, 
    we can use that information to find limits of related sequences. 
    We can think of this as the arithmetic of infinity. 
    Infinities can add and multiply but should never be subtracted or divided from one another. 
    The most important principle to remember is that infinities should never cancel one another. 
    Cases where the formula looks like infinities might cancel are called indeterminate. 
    This means that the actual value can not be determined without further analysis. 
    A ratio of terms becoming infinitely small, <m>0/0</m>, is also indeterminate.

    </theorem>
    
    <p>
    The previous theorem was stated somewhat imprecisely in order to convey 
    the idea of arithmetic of infinities without being bogged down by formal notation relating to limits. 
    Each statement really is about a limit.
    </p>
    <p>
    As an example, the arithmetic on infinity <m>+\infty + +\infty = +\infty</m> 
    should more properly be stated as follows. 
    Suppose that there are two sequences <m>x_n</m> and <m>y_n</m> such that 
    <m>x_n \to +\infty</m> and <m>y_n \to +\infty</m>. 
    The sequence defined by <m>u_n = x_n + y_n</m> has limit <me>\lim_{n \to \infty} x_n + y_n = +\infty.</me>
    </p>
    <p>
    The shorthand notation of performing arithmetic with infinity allows this to be simplified as writing 
    <me> \lim_{n \to \infty} x_n + y_n = +\infty + +\infty = +\infty.</me> 
    The intermediate step <m>+\infty + +\infty</m> is not truly arithmetic, 
    but points out that <m>x_n \to +\infty</m> and <m>y_n \to +\infty</m>, 
    and since those sequences were added, the final limit is also <m>+\infty</m>. 
    As long as the arithmetic involves no cancelation of infinities, it will result in a correct statement.
    </p>
    
    <p>
    To deal with indeterminate forms, we usually need to try to rewrite the formula 
    in a new way so that the cancellation does not apply.
    </p>
    
    <example>
      <statement>
        <p>Determine the following limits, if possible.</p>

          <li><m>\displaystyle \lim_{n \to \infty} 3+\frac{5}{2^n}</m></li>
          <li><m>\displaystyle \lim_{n \to \infty} \frac{n^2-3n}{5n-1}</m></li>
          <li><m>\displaystyle \lim_{n \to \infty} \frac{1+2^n}{3+5^n}</m></li>
        </ol>
      </statement>
      <solution>
        <ol>
          <li>
            <p>
            The sequence <m>x_n = 3 + \frac{5}{2^n}</m> is the sum of terms 
            <m>3</m> and <m>\frac{5}{2^n}</m>. 
            The constant sequence has a limit <m>3 \to 3</m> (since it never changes). 
            The geometric sequence <m>\frac{5}{2^n} = 5 \cdot (\frac{1}{2})^n</m> 
            has a ratio <m>|\rho| \lt 1</m> so that <m>\frac{5}{2^n} \to 0</m>. 
            The form of the limit (using the terms) is 
            <me> \lim_{n \to \infty} 3 + \frac{5}{2^n} = 3 + 0,</me> 
            and since this does not involve any cancelation of infinities, will give the correct limit, 
            <me>\lim_{n \to \infty} 3+\frac{5}{2^n} = 3+0 = 3.</me>
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
            The sequence <m>\displaystyle u_n = \frac{n^2-3n}{5n-1}</m> is a quotient of terms 
            <m>n^2-3n</m> and <m>5n-1</m>. 
            To find the limit, we explore the terms individually first.
            </p>
            <p>
            Because <m>n^2 = n \cdot n</m>, we know <m>n^2 \to +\infty \cdot +\infty = +\infty</m>. 
            Similarly, the arithmetic sequence <m>3n \to +\infty</m>. 
            However, the difference <m>n^2 - 3n</m> would have a limit of the form <m>+\infty - \infty</m>, 
            which is a cancellation of infinities. 
            As written, <m>n^2-3n</m> is an indeterminate form. 
            Our strategy will be to rewrite this as a product, 
            and the best practice is to factor out (divide out) the greatest power of <m>n</m>, 
            <me> n^2-3n =  n^2(\frac{n^2}{n^2} - \frac{3n}{n^2}) = n^2 (1 - \frac{3}{n}).</me> 
            From this, we find <me>\frac{3}{n} \to \frac{3}{+\infty} = 0 \quad \Rightarrow \quad 1-\frac{3}{n} \to 1-0 = 1.</me> 
            Since we already know <m>n^2 \to +\infty</m>, we have the limit of the numerator 
            <me> \lim_{n \to \infty} n^2-3n = \lim_{n \to \infty} n^2(1-\frac{3}{n}) = +\infty \cdot 1 = +\infty.</me>
            </p>
            <p>
            The term in the denominator <m>5n-1</m> is an arithmetic sequence (linear function) 
            with increment (slope) <m>c=5</m>.
            We know <me>\lim_{n \to \infty} 5n-1 = +\infty.</me> 
            Unfortunately, that means our limit form as a quotient is itself an indeterminate form, 
            <me> \lim_{n \to \infty} \frac{n^2-3n}{5n-1} = \frac{+\infty}{+\infty}.</me> 
            We can not cancel infinities, so we must rewrite our formula.
            </p>
            <p>
            For this example, I worked out the numerator separately to make a point about 
            that term itself being an indeterminate form. 
            In practice, our strategy will be to apply that factoring principle to the entire formula at one step.
            This is illustrated below.</p>
            <p>
            The problem can be solved up if we just factor out from the numerator and denominator 
            the dominant term (greatest power) and simplify as needed.

            This indeterminate form involves canceling infinities, so we must rewrite the formula.

    When a sequence <m>x</m> is defined recursively by a projection function <m>f</m>,

    The reason that we search for fixed points is that if we know there is a limit
    for a recursively defined sequence, the limit will usually be a fixed point of the projection function.

      <title>Recursive Limits as Fixed Points</title>
      <statement>
        <p>
        If a sequence is defined recursively with a continuous projection function <m>f</m>, 
        <m>x_{n+1}=f(x_n)</m>, and <m>x_n</m> has a limit, 
        then the limit must be a fixed point of <m>f</m>.

    </theorem>
    
    <p>
    Note some things that this theorem does not guarantee. 
    First, just because a function has a fixed point does not mean that it will be a limit.
    (The sequence might not have a limit.) 
    Second, the projection function needs to be continuous. 
    If a function is not continuous, then it is possible to have a limit that is not a fixed point. 
    Fortunately, functions defined by simple algebraic formulas will be continuous everywhere they are defined.
    For any continuous projection functions, the only limits <em>will</em> be fixed points.
    </p>
    
    <p>
    In practice, we first observe that a sequence defined recursively has a limit 
    (perhaps through a graph or a table) but can not determine the value of the limit. 
    If we find all of the fixed points for the projection function, 
    then we can determine which of those is the appropriate limit. 
    The limit may depend on the initial value of the sequence, 
    so we compare approximate values from the table with the approximate (decimal) values of the fixed points.
    </p>
    
    <example>
      <statement>
        <p>
        We in an example above that the sequence defined recursively by 
        <m>z_{n+1} = 2.7 z_n-0.7z_n^2</m> and initial value <m>z_0 = 1</m>, 
        and that the approximate value of the limit was <m>2.428</m>. 
        What is the exact value of the limit?
        </p>
      </statement>
      <solution>
        <p>
        The projection function <me>f : z_n \mapsto z_{n+1}=2.7z_n - 0.7z_n^2</me> is defined by the formula 
        <me>f(x) = 2.7x-0.7x^2</me>. 
        This function involves simple algebra and is defined everywhere.
        Therefore, the projection function <m>f</m> is continuous and the limit must be a fixed point.

    Fixed points are also useful in finding the explicit formula for sequences 
    defined by linear projection functions. 
    Suppose a sequence is defined recursively by the equation <m>x_{n+1} = \alpha x_n + c</m>.
    When <m>c=0</m>, we have a geometric sequence.
    When <m>\alpha = 1</m> we have an arithmetic sequence.
    The projection function <m>f:x_n \mapsto x_{n+1}</m> is defined 
    by the formula <m>f(x) = \alpha x + c</m>. 
    The fixed point <m>x^*</m> is the solution to 
    <me>\alpha x + c = x \qquad \Leftrightarrow \qquad x^* = \frac{c}{1-\alpha},</me> 
    defined only for <m>\alpha \ne 1</m>.
    </p>
    
    <p>
    The linear projection function can be rewritten in terms of the fixed point 
    using slope <m>\alpha</m> and point <m>(x^*,x^*)</m> as
    <me>f(x) = x^* + \alpha(x-x^*)</me>. 
    This means that the recurrence relation can be written
    <me>x_{n+1} = x^* + \alpha(x_n-x^*) \quad \Leftrightarrow \quad x_{n+1}-x^* = \alpha(x_n-x^*)</me>.
    Consequently, <m>x_n-x^*</m> is a geometric sequence.
    This allows us to find an explicit formula for <m>x_n</m>.

    Now that we have a method for finding the explicit formula for a sequence
    with a linear projection function, we can apply that formula to analyze
    applied models.
    </p>
    
    <example>
      <statement>
        <p>
        Suppose a patient begins taking <quantity><mag>500</mag><unit prefix="milli" base="gram"/></quantity> 
        of a drug every four hours. 
        However, the body metabolizes 60<percent/> of the drug in the body every four hours. 
        Find a formula for the amount of drug in the body immediately after each dose 
        and then determine the limiting value.
        </p>
      </statement>
      <solution>
        <p>
        The body starts with no drug. 
        Immediately after the first dose, 
        there are <quantity><mag>500</mag><unit prefix="milli" base="gram"/></quantity>. 
        Four hours later, 60<percent/> has been removed and then another dose is added in. 
        If we let <m>D_n</m> be the sequence of drug mass in the body 
        as a function of the number of doses <m>n</m>, 
        then this is modeled recursively by the equation 
        <me>D_{n+1} = D_n - 0.6 D_n + 500,</me> with initial value <m>D_1 = 500</m>.
        </p>
        <p>
        This model has a linear projection function <m>f(x) = 0.4x+500</m> 
        and corresponding fixed point 
        <me> 0.4x+500=x \quad \Leftrightarrow \quad x=\frac{500}{0.6} = \frac{2500}{3}.</me>
        The explicit formula, using <xref ref="thm-linear-projection-explicit"/>, 
        is given by <me>D_n = \frac{2500}{3} + (500 - \frac{2500}{3}) \cdot 0.4^{n-1} = \frac{2500}{3} - \frac{1000}{3} \cdot 0.4^{n-1}.</me> 
        Because the slope of the projection function <m>\alpha = 0.4</m> has magnitude less than 1, 
        the limiting value is the fixed point <m>x^* = \frac{2500}{3} \approx 833.33</m>. 
        Thus, if the patient continues to take the drug, 
        the amount in the body immediately after each dose will be approximately 
        <quantity><mag>833.33</mag><unit prefix="milli" base="gram"/></quantity>. 
        (Immediately before the dose, it must have been approximately 
        <quantity><mag>333.33</mag><unit prefix="milli" base="gram"/></quantity>.)

        with the exception that any formula that would cancel infinity are indeterminate.
        (See <xref ref="thm-arithmetic-infinity"/>)
        Indeterminate means the limit can not be determined from simple arithmetic

          When a patient starts taking a drug, there is no drug in the blood.
          The prescription is to take 
          <quantity><mag>250</mag><unit prefix="milli" base="gram"/></quantity>
          every six hours.
          Then, during the six hours between doses, 
          the body metabolizes 20<percent/> of whatever drug is in the body.

          A pond has been polluted by a stream. 
          The pond holds 12,000 gallons of water
          and the stream replaces 900 gallons per day.
          The stream has been carrying the chemical pollutant at a concentration of 
          <quantity><mag>0.4</mag><unit base="gram"/><per base="gallon"/></quantity>
          and now the pond has that same pollution level.
          With stream cleanup, the chemical pollutant in the stream
          has just been reduced to a concentration of 
          <quantity><mag>0.1</mag><unit base="gram"/><per base="gallon"/></quantity>.

          <p>
          Find a recursive formula using a linear projection function 
          for the sequence of pollutant levels (total mass) in the pond
          with an index counting the number of days since the cleanup occurred.
          Clearly state the initial value.
          Find an explicit formula for the sequence and determine the limit.
          On what day will the total amount of pollutant in the pond be reduced
          to half of the pollution level prior to cleanup?
          Is there a steady state amount of pollutant in the pond?
