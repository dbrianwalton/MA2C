  <title>The Derivative</title>
  <subsection>
    <title>Overview</title>
    <p>
      Given a function, the derivative at a point allows us to measure the instantaneous rate of change at that point.
      This rate of change is defined as the limiting value of the average rate of change
      as the space between the two points used approaches zero.
      It would be quite tedious to compute the derivative at each point using this process.
      Fortunately, we can create a function known as the derivative that does this for us.
    </p>
    <p>
      In this section, we introduce the derivative as a function rather than an isolated calculation.
      The definition of the derivative is still in terms of a limit,
      but with the point in question represented by a variable.
      The domain of the derivative consists of all points where the limit exists,
      and corresponds to the set of points where a tangent line can be defined as a function.
      For algebraically defined functions, we can use the limit and algebra
      to find an algebraic formula for the derivative.
      Several examples illustrate this process.
      The derivative function can then be used to calculate the instantaneous rate at any desired point.

    <title>Introducing the Derivative</title>
    <p>
      A function is a rule that associates a unique output with each input value.
      When we look at the graph of a function, the points on the graph are placed
      so that the input value is the first coordinate (e.g., <m>x</m>)
      and the output value is the second coordinate (e.g., <m>y</m>).
      Using the graph, we can find the value of the function for a given input
      by looking for the input along the horizontal (<m>x</m>) axis
      and then finding the point on the graph intersecting the corresponding vertical line.
      The height of that point gives the output value of the function.
    </p>
    <p>
      If that point of the graph has a well-defined tangent line,
      then we could define another function that has as its output the slope of the tangent line at that point.
      This function is called the derivative function.
      The following website provides an interactive illustration of this concept:
      <url href="http://www.intmath.com/differentiation/derivative-graphs.php"/>
    </p>
    <p>
      Consider the figure illustrated below.
      The graph of a function <m>y=f(x)</m>is given
      and short segments of the tangent lines at various points have also been included.
      The point at <m>x=-1</m> has a <m>y</m>-value of 2 and a slope of 0 (horizontal tangent line).
      So <m>f(-1)=2</m> while <m>\frac{df}{dx}(-1)=0</m>.
      The point at <m>x=0</m> has a <m>y</m>-value of 0 and a slope of -3,
      so <m>f(0)=0</m> and <m>\frac{df}{dx}(0)=-3</m>.
      The third point, at <m>x=2</m> has a <m>y</m>-value of 2 and a slope of 9,
      corresponding to <m>f(2)=2</m> and <m>\frac{df}{dx}(2)=9</m>.
      The equations of these tangent lines, listed in the same order as described above,
      and written in point<ndash />slope form, are given by

      <title>The Derivative</title>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Suppose <m>f</m> is a function relating two variables <m>f:x \mapsto y</m>.
          The derivative of <m>y</m> is a new dependent variable <m>\frac{dy}{dx}</m>
          that for every value of the independent variable, <m>x=a</m>,
          has a value equal to the instantaneous rate of change, <m>\frac{dy}{dx}=\frac{dy}{dx}\Big|_a</m>.
          The function <m>f' : x \mapsto \frac{dy}{dx}</m> is called the <term>derivative</term> of <m>f</m>.
          That is,
          <me>f'(x) = \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{f(x+h)-f(x)}{h}</me>.
          The domain of <m>f'</m> is the set of all values <m>x</m> where the limit exists.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </definition>
    <p>
      Our previous use of the notation <m>f'</m> to represent the rate of accumulation of an accumulation function was intentional.
      It looked ahead to the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus that connects the ideas of derivatives and integrals.
      In this section, we will use the names <m>f'</m> and <m>\frac{df}{dx}</m> interchangeably.
      The Fundamental Theorem of Calculus will justify this equivalence later.

    <title>Examples of Calculation</title>
    <p>
      Recall that the definition of the instantaneous rate of change (which is what the derivative measures)
      is the limiting value of an average rate of change of the function between two points
      as the second point approaches the first.
      When computing the derivative, we will use two points at symbolic values <m>x</m> (the point of interest)
      and <m>x+h</m> (the second point), where <m>h</m> is the spacing between the two points.
      The second point approaches the first when <m>h \to 0</m>.
      The basic process is outlined in the following steps:
      <ol>
        <li>
          <p>Compute <m>f(x+h)</m> using the rule for <m>f(x)</m>. (Find the output for the second point.)</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Compute <m>f(x+h)-f(x)</m> and simplify. (Find the change in output.)</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Simplify <m>\displaystyle \frac{\Delta f}{\Delta x} = \frac{f(x+h)-f(x)}{h}</m>.
            (Determine a simplified formula for the average rate of change.)
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Determine <m>\displaystyle \frac{df}{dx} = \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{f(x+h)-f(x)}{h}</m>.
            (Evaluate the limiting value as the second point approaches the first.)
          </p>
        </li>
      </ol>
    </p>
    <example>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Use the definition of the derivative to find <m>\frac{df}{dx}</m> where <m>f(x) = x^2-3x</m>.
        </p>
      </statement>
      <solution>
        <p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <p>
                Find the output at the second point:
                <me>f(x+h) = (x+h)^2-3(x+h) = x^2+2xh+h^2-3x-3h</me>.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                Find the change in output between the two points:
                <md>
                  <mrow> f(x+h)-f(x) &amp;= (x^2+2xh+h^2-3x-3h)- (x^2-3x) </mrow>
                  <mrow> &amp; = x^2+2xh+h^2-3x-3h-x^2+3x </mrow>
                  <mrow> &amp; = 2xh+h^2-3h. </mrow>
                </md>
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                Simplify the average rate of change between the two points:
                <md>
                  <mrow> \frac{f(x+h)-f(x)}{h} &amp; = \frac{2xh+h^2-3h}{h} </mrow>
                  <mrow> &amp; = \frac{h(2x+h-3)}{h} </mrow>
                  <mrow> &amp; = 2x+h-3. </mrow>
                </md>
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                The derivative is the limit of the average rate of change:
                <md>
                  <mrow> \frac{df}{dx} &amp; = \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{f(x+h)-f(x)}{h} </mrow>
                  <mrow> &amp; = \lim_{h \to 0} 2x+h-3 </mrow>
                  <mrow> &amp; = 2x+0-3 = 2x-3. </mrow>
                </md>
                So we have found the derivative function, <m>\frac{df}{dx}(x) = 2x-3</m>.
                We can see this exactly agrees with the rate of accumulation <m>f'(x)=2x-3</m>
                that we earlier learned to find in terms of the elementary accumulation formulas.
              </p>

          </ul>
        </p>
      </solution>
    </example>
    <p>
      Often it is more convenient to combine some of these steps together.
      However, just be careful that you create valid equations.
      Always have an equation that says what you are computing,
      and do not write that two things are equal when they are not the same.
      In the previous example, note how each time I started to compute a new expression, I created a new system of equations.
    </p>
    <p>
      In this next example, we are reminded of the need to find a common denominator when a fraction is involved.
      Also, it is useful to recall that division by a number <m>h</m>is the same as multiplication by its inverse <m>1/h</m>.
    </p>
    <example>
      <statement>
        <p>Use the definition of the derivative to find <m>f'(x)</m> where <m>\displaystyle f(x) = \frac{1}{2x+3}</m>.</p>
      </statement>
      <solution>
        <p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <p>
                Find the output at the second point:
                <me>f(x+h) = \frac{1}{2(x+h)+3} = \frac{1}{2x+2h+3}</me>.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                Find the change in output between the two points:
                <me> f(x+h)-f(x) = \frac{1}{2x+2h+3}- \frac{1}{2x+3}</me>.
                Here is where we will need to use a common denominator.
                Recall from ordinary fractions that a common denominator is formed by multiplying the top and bottom by a missing factor.
                <md>
                  <mrow> f(x+h)-f(x) &amp; = \frac{(2x+3)}{(2x+3)(2x+2h+3)} - \frac{(2x+2h+3)}{(2x+3)(2x+2h+3)} </mrow>
                  <mrow> &amp; = \frac{(2x+3)-(2x+2h+3)}{(2x+3)(2x+2h+3)} </mrow>
                  <mrow> &amp; = \frac{-2h}{(2x+3)(2x+2h+3)} </mrow>

            <li>
              <p>
                Simplify the average rate of change between the two points.
                However, it is dangerous to write a fraction divided by something (division is not associative),
                so we will write division by <m>h</m> as multiplication by <m>1/h</m>
                and simplify the resulting expression:
                <md>
                  <mrow> \frac{f(x+h)-f(x)}{h} &amp; = \frac{-2h}{(2x+3)(2x+2h+3)} \cdot \frac{1}{h} </mrow>
                  <mrow> &amp; = \frac{-2}{(2x+3)(2x+2h+3)} </mrow>
                </md>
                Your goal at the simplification step should always be to make the <m>h</m> cancel as a common factor.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                The derivative is the limit of the average rate of change:
                <md>
                  <mrow> \frac{df}{dx} &amp; = \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{f(x+h)-f(x)}{h} </mrow>

                  <mrow> &amp; = \frac{-2}{(2x+3)^2}. </mrow>
                </md>
                This gives us the derivative function,
                <me>\frac{df}{dx} = \frac{-2}{(2x+3)^2}.</me>
              </p>

        </p>
      </solution>
    </example>
    <p>
      For our last examples, we consider finding the derivative using the definition when the function involves the square root.
      We will find it necessary to use a trick from algebra involving conjugate pairs.
      Recall that <m>(a+b)(a-b) = a^2-b^2</m>.
      If <m>a</m> or <m>b</m> is a square root of some value,
      then the product of these conjugate pairs will have the square of the square root,
      thereby no longer involving the square root.
      For example,
      <me>(\sqrt{x}-2)(\sqrt{x}+2) = (\sqrt{x})^2 - (2)^2 = x-4.</me>

        <p>
          If <m>f</m> is differentiable at <m>a</m>,

      <proof>
        <p>
          Suppose that <m>f</m> is differentiable at <m>a</m>.
          This means that <m>f'(a)</m> is a value defined by
          <me> \lim_{x \to a}\frac{f(x)-f(a)}{x-a} = f'(a).</me>
          We also know that <me> \lim_{x \to a}[x-a] = a-a = 0.</me>
          Using the product rule for limits (<xref ref='LC-Product' text='custom'>LC:Product</xref>),
          this implies

          Because <m>\displaystyle \lim_{x \to a} f(a) = f(a)</m> (<xref ref='LE-Constant' text='custom'>LE:Constant</xref>),
          we know that
          <me>\lim_{x \to a} f(x) = \lim_{x \to a} [f(x)-f(a) + f(a)] = 0 + f(a) = f(a)</me>
          using the sum rule (<xref ref='LC-Sum' text='custom'>LC:Sum</xref>).

      Another way that a function might not have be differentiable is where it is continuous but has a corner.
      This means that the slope at the point looks different from either of the two sides.
      Mathematically, if we computed the one-sided limits of the difference quotient defining the derivative,
      we would get two different values.
      The difference quotient has a jump discontinuity at <m>h=0</m>.
